    "According to the [Meteorological Services Singapore](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-climate-of-singapore/#:~:text=Singapore%20is%20situated%20near%20the,month%2Dto%2Dmonth%20variation.), Singapore has typical tropical climate with adundant rainfall, high and uniform temperatures and high humidity all year round, since its situated near the equator. There are many factors that help us understand the climate of a country and in this project we are going to look into a few, especially rainfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Singapore’s climate is characterised by two main monsoon seasons separated by inter-monsoonal periods.  The **Northeast Monsoon** occurs from December to early March, and the **Southwest Monsoon** from June to September.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major weather systems affecting Singapore that can lead to heavy rainfall are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Monsoon surges, or strong wind episodes in the Northeast Monsoon flow bringing about major rainfall events;\n",
    "\n",
    "-Sumatra squalls, an organised line of thunderstorms travelling eastward across Singapore, having developed over the island of Sumatra or Straits of Malacca west of us;\n",
    "\n",
    "-Afternoon and evening thunderstorms caused by strong surface heating and by the sea breeze circulation that develops in the afternoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Singapore’s climate station has been located at several different sites in the past 140 years. The station had been decommissioned at various points in the past due to changes to local land use in the site’s vicinity, and had to be relocated. Since 1984, the climate station has been located at **Changi**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other metrics of climate such as temperature, humidity, sun shine duration, wind speed, cloud cover etc. All the dataset used in the project comes from [data.gov.sg](data.gov.sg), as recorded at the Changi climate station \n"

Not only does it allow you to quickly convey your findings (even if you have a non-technical audience), it will often reveal trends in your data that escaped you when you were looking only at numbers. It is important to not only create visualizations, but to **interpret your visualizations** as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every plot should**:\n",
    "- Have a title\n",

    "Here are some prompts to get you started with visualizations. Feel free to add additional visualizations as you see fit:\n",
    "1. Use Seaborn's heatmap with pandas `.corr()` to visualize correlations between all numeric features.\n",
    "    - Heatmaps are generally not appropriate for presentations, and should often be excluded from reports as they can be visually overwhelming. **However**, they can be extremely useful in identify relationships of potential interest (as well as identifying potential collinearity before modeling).\n",
    "    - Please take time to format your output, adding a title. Look through some of the additional arguments and options. (Axis labels aren't really necessary, as long as the title is informative).\n",
    "2. Visualize distributions using histograms. If you have a lot, consider writing a custom function and use subplots.\n",
    "    - *OPTIONAL*: Summarize the underlying distributions of your features (in words & statistics)\n",
    "         - Be thorough in your verbal description of these distributions.\n",
    "         - Be sure to back up these summaries with statistics.\n",
    "         - We generally assume that data we sample from a population will be normally distributed. Do we observe this trend? Explain your answers for each distribution and how you think this will affect estimates made from these data.\n",
    "3. Plot and interpret boxplots. \n",
    "    - Boxplots demonstrate central tendency and spread in variables. In a certain sense, these are somewhat redundant with histograms, but you may be better able to identify clear outliers or differences in IQR, etc.\n",
    "    - Multiple values can be plotted to a single boxplot as long as they are of the same relative scale (meaning they have similar min/max values).\n",
    "    - Each boxplot should:\n",
    "        - Only include variables of a similar scale\n",
    "        - Have clear labels for each variable\n",
    "        - Have appropriate titles and labels\n",
    "4. Plot and interpret scatter plots to view relationships between features. Feel free to write a custom function, and subplot if you'd like. Functions save both time and space.\n",
    "    - Your plots should have:\n",
    "        - Two clearly labeled axes\n",
    "        - A proper title\n",
    "        - Colors and symbols that are clear and unmistakable\n",
    "5. Additional plots of your choosing.\n",
    "    - Are there any additional trends or relationships you haven't explored? Was there something interesting you saw that you'd like to dive further into? It's likely that there are a few more plots you might want to generate to support your narrative and recommendations that you are building toward. **As always, make sure you're interpreting your plots as you go**."
