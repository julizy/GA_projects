SleepApnea,"I've been using APAP for years, but there's something that's bugging me.

Resmed 10 Autoset, EPR 3 (works best for me) and standard response. 

If my minimum pressure is set to 6cm, it doesn't go above 7cm all night but I wake up numerous times and can feel like I'm not getting enough airflow and can feel the instant slight pressure change in my semi-conscious state which allows me to continue breathing, before going back to sleep.

However if my minimum is set to 8cm, my 95% pressure for the night will be somewhere around 9.4cm.

And I feel much better on minimum 8cm, however this carries some discomfort on exhalation despite the EPR 3 - which I believe doesn't ensure I get the best night's sleep.

I've just bought the Aircurve 10 SVAuto so I can have a minimum of 9cm and exhalation pressure 4-5cm to see if that's a much more therapeutic and comfortable nights sleep.

SleepApnea,"Just earlier today I found out I had an AHI of 13 per hour, which is enough to diagnose a case of mild sleep apnea. I want to get treatment ASAP but the sleep clinic told me I would have to wait until the 22nd (almost 2 weeks from now) for a phone consultation to see if my insurance will cover a CPAP machine, after which I may get another in-clinic appointment scheduled. I already told them my insurance plan includes ""approved respiratory equipment"" and that I wanted one soon, but I still have to jump through the hoops. I called my doctor to see if I could get a CPAP machine sooner, he told me as my case is mild I don't need one. I asked him what other treatment I can seek, and he said since it's a mild case I wouldn't need any treatment. I was pretty upset and I asked him what I could even do and he just told me to sleep on my side. Most days I do sleep on my side but it was hard to with the sleep study kit. 

I'm worried because I have no idea when, if ever, I can get treatment. How are my chances of getting a CPAP machine through the sleep clinic? Clearly my case should be taken seriously if it's affecting my quality of life enough for me to seek out a sleep study right? Is a mild case of sleep apnea really curable by just sleeping on my side? I feel ridiculous even typing that out because I get terrible sleep even if I am on my side but my doctor is making me doubt myself. Then again, he was extremely hesitant to even refer me to a sleep clinic in the first place. It seemed like he wasn't taking my concerns about sleep apnea seriously because I'm young and have a low-normal BMI, so it follows he might not take the results of the sleep study seriously either.   
Sorry if this post is long and ranty. I'm honestly frustrated and confused.

I never recall dreams nowadays, and RARELY wake up with morning wood. Would also like to hear success stories with CPAP for mild sleep apnea/ UARS.

SleepApnea,"It’s about 20 months since my body gave up on me and I entered into extreme fatigue. I’ve been on CPAP exactly one year now and I’m definitely crawling out of that pit. Also insulin resistant/prediabetic and I modified my diet/exercise and it’s working albeit slowly. It’s manageable now. I’m single and live alone. It’s been a solitary journey but as I slowly come out of it I think about my life and the people in it and what it means. People are sympathetic but only up to a point. Then they just forget about you. I’ve come to the conclusion that most people are incredibly ego centric and when you can’t give them what they want they drift away. The kindness and compassion that gets talked about around social issues (my friends are big on current social issue trends) is absent when there’s need right in front of them. It just requires they put themselves to one side and just be there for someone. There’s no opinion needed or problem to fix. Theres nothing to talk about. There’s nothing anyone can do. Just be there. But it’s too difficult for many I’ve noticed. It’s changed a large part of my outlook on relationships and it’s made me stronger. I feel like I’ll be more careful where I place my friendship in the future.

SleepApnea,"Hi all,

So my father is in his late 60's, a bit overweight for his BMI and has been abruptly falling asleep in the late afternoons/evenings for the past few years now. It's been over 15 years that his breathing would stop in his sleep and only 3-4 years ago has he been diagnosed with his sleep apnea.

He got two different types of masks from the hospital. I believe you call them the CPAP devices.

Both bothered him enormously. The first would blow like a tornado in his face and the strings would be too tight causing irritation - so he got sick of this after a month of use, stating that he didn't feel improvement at all and just got annoyed and couldn't properly sleep with it.

The second mask didn't surround his whole face, but for some reason he felt like he had a constant cold or flu in the weeks after starting the mask... Needless to say he stopped wearing this one too and now doesn't want to wear any mask anymore.

I am a bit worried though and see no way of convincing him to try again. Is there anything that you could offer as advice on how to convince him to try again and/or tips on the issues he faced?

SleepApnea,"I was diagnosed in 2020 with Sleep Apnea and had approximately 37-40 episodes per hour during my sleep test. Recently i've had to quit my job due to the negative effects, being unable to stay awake, daytime drowsiness, low motivation.

I tried the CPAP for continuous 6 months and it brought me down to 13-17 AHI but I was still extremely tired every morning and I was waking up in the middle of the night and not able to fall back asleep with my longest recorded sleep time of 6 hours.

Tonight I used a different mask that I purchased online which I find to be more comfortable and although I only slept for 4.5 hours straight, my AHI was only 3.7.

for the first time I am actually feeling hopeful about the CPAP working for me.

My only issue now is not being able to stay asleep for an entire night, does anybody take medications to sleep with their CPAP? I am not sure if it's the pressures waking me up or something else I am not a very heavy sleeper.

SleepApnea,"I’ve been smoking weed daily for the last 4 years or so. I live in Brazil, good weed is very expensive here(and it ain’t that good), so especially when I was younger, I was smoking the shittiest weed any of you first world country people have ever seen. It’s called “prensado”, which translates to “pressed”, and it’s pretty self explanatory. It comes from all over the tropical part of latin america, and the producers only mind the potency, they press it almost fresh and ship it illegally to Brazil.
Recently i’ve been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea, even though i’m not overweight and only 20 years old. This condition is believed to be more common in the city, since it’s related to congested airways and the pollution aggravates breathing problems in general. I’d considered the possibility of weed being a contributing factor, but not until last week I realized how much of a cause it is.
Of course, from time to time, i’d smoke a good joint, actual flower or hash, which I have grown myself a couple of times also, but i never could keep up with my smoking habits. Since my last college break,in January, when all my friends and family were away traveling, I started spending a load of money on good weed. But for the last month i’ve been only smoking hash, and that was a turning point.
It took a while for the inflammation to cease completely, but i’m breathing better than I have in years. Not a single time have I felt asthma when smoking, which was pretty common, my sleep has significantly improved, even though school has me slightly sleep deprived, and absolutely no stuffy nose at any time of the day.
So, I assume the problem comes from burning plant material. Maybe mold, or the chlorophyll from an incomplete curing process, which is standard even for good flower here. Has anyone had any similar issues? allergy in general or asthma when smoking? weed and drug abuse are really common between people with sleep apnea, hence the pain caused by the condition, so I feel there might be an interesting relation here.
Thank you for the attention, i’d love to hear your responses.

SleepApnea,"To preface I am still undiagnosed but I suspect sleep apnea. I have an appointment with a specialist in a month and will be doing a sleep study.   


I tore my (24m) acl and meniscus 12 months ago and haven't been doing cardio sports like before. I had to wait for surgery and the recovery has been slow. Went from very active and lean muscle 5'9, 145lbs to 165lbs. I'd still say I am relatively in shape. Most of it is muscle mass since I have been hitting the gym 4-5 times a week but I also gained a solid amount of fat. Also got corona 4 months ago. Symptoms include: headaches after waking, tiredness during day/after waking, brain fog, lack of concentration, depressive episodes, waking at night panicked. I also seem to have developed bed time anxiety.

SleepApnea,"Here's a portion of a night from when I was doing this study. I put the resmed on a slow ramp, going from 6 to 9, over 45 minutes. And I slept on my back just to see how it would go.  My normal thing on my back is to have a once-per-minute apnea cycle that shows up pretty clearly. This happens basically every time I'm on my back. The apnea cycle starts, my O2 stays relatively high (above 90%) and cycles somewhat, while my pulse cycles between 55 and 75. 


Then as the pressure increased a bit, the apnea cycling stopped and I was breathing steadily. One might say that's an improvement, but I don't think so. Once the apnea cycle stopped, my O2 levels dropped, and my heart rate went up and stayed high. The red ellipses encircle not quite the same time periods- in the O2 and pulse graphs, the red circles go a little too far left, and get some of the time (4 or 5 minutes) when the apnea cycle is happeneing, and this can be seen in the cyclic nature of the pulse and O2. 

https://imgur.com/a/MyuXtF9


So it looks to me from this that the apnea cycle might be healthier than the non-apnea time where the O2 dropped and the heart rate increased. 

Also, the plot for ""Flow Limitation"" is probably inaccurate here, as the Resmed doesn't calculate that during the ramp time. 

I did this home study thing for about a week, and there were about 10 periods where I was supine and the once-per-minute apnea cycle stopped. And every time, it made my pulse ramp way up and my O2 drop. So the image I've linked isn't a one-time thing, it is the pattern.


Also, I find it interesting that in this home DIY titration study, that (while supine) I DIDN'T find a pressure range where I don't have the apnea cycle or the highly-restricted breathing resulting in low O2 and the high heart rate.  To me, that means the concept of apnea titration using increasing pressure is just not a thing that applies to me, for the supine position, for pressures up to 16 cmH2O. 


Any thoughts would be welcome, especially thoughts on which is preferable- highly-restricted breathing or an apnea cycle, or thoughts on if pressure titration is often just not useful or fails outright, or thoughts on how hyperventilating for 30 seconds and then just not breathing for 30 seconds becomes a thing the body will just do, and how it's kinda weird but kinda works, or anything else.

SleepApnea,"  

I'm back again, I have been analyzing my OSCAR data for past 2 years and it is driving me insane that my breathing almost behave the same no matter which mode or what pressure!

What is my problem and why I am trying to tweak such low AHI ? The more arousals I have in my sleep ( conscious arousals where I'm aware of my surrounding and have time to stop/restart the machine to mark an arousal and remember my dream, then go back to sleep; the more arousals I get, the worse my sleep is, which leads me to wake up as ""zombie"" can not do anything other than trying to go back to bed and hope I could fall asleep for a nap even a minute ( I can not nap, I am awaken with almost snore like airflow limitation as soon as I drift to sleep), if that happens, the zombie effect subsids for few hours before returning, nothing can fix it till it is sleep time and I try another night.

First important notes:

1- I can NOT sleep without my PAP machine, my arousals are much more often and I get an almost snore then arousal, so a PAP machine helps in some way, I just can not figure out what settings would help the MOST.

2- I have been trying to take very thorough screenshots, so there are many breathing zoomed in screenshot before an arousal, an arousal would be understood when the machine power is off then on again.

3- this is A LOT of data, I honestly see flow limitations in my airflow I see repetitive behavior like an interrupted inhale breath with a sudden high amplitude inhale then exhale, but I can not know what really is the best settings.

4- A custom user flag 1 red is a 50% flow restriction for 8 seconds, a user flag 2 green is a 20% restriction for 5 seconds.

4- I'll try to leave some notes before the screenshot, but these screenshot are for VAUTO mode ( different settings), S mode (different settings) and CPAP mode (different settings), I ""think"" that my nervous system is hypersensitive to airflow variations and that is why it keeps waking me up through the night, so I think CPAP and S-mode work better than VAUTO for my body.

5- These symptoms started 5 YEARS ago, after a neck accident, a sleep study showed apnea, PAP machine could not fix it, i then undergone 4 apnea surgeries: genioglossus advancement and hyoid bone myotomy, glossectomy, UPPP and styloidectomy ( was not necessary), before these, i Used to feel a ""spasm"" in my arytenoids every time I'm drifting to sleep or wake up with a sudden diaphragm expansion, like a sudden inhale of air right before an arousal, I think it was RERA or my nervous system becoming hypersensitive after the accident, I'm not sure.

I DON'T ANYMORE, but i get the sudden airflow tightening which lead to an arousal, hence the PAP machine need, it fights that narrowing airflow so I can drift to sleep, it fights this repeatable sudden inhale that happens every 15-20 mns while i am sleeping, so I don't wake up.

6- In the last year or so, I started to take sedating medication, as I found out when I'm sedating I wake up less, which lead to a better sleep, but with time the effect of sedating meds weakened, and my doctor kept adding more meds to try which in term worked for few months then weaned down, I am planning on cutting down on these meds, but for now they help me fall asleep ""on time"" and stay longer in bed. I do need to stay longer in bed to not become ""zombie"" 8 hrs DOES NOT work anymore for me, I need to continue the sleep/arousal dance for 10-11hrs a night to have a chance not to be ""zombie""

SleepApnea,"I just returned home from a sleep study, and I'm largely confused about what to think. I was hooked up with an oxygen cannula that was definitely off at the beginning, but when I woke up early in the study, it seemed like it might have been turned on. The inside of my nose had a cool feeling, and I was actually able to breathe through both nostrils, which is rare for me. I wound up waking up 4-5 times and needing to readjust my body, but I usually wake up 0-1 times per night, at least that I was previously aware.

Is it possible that oxygen being turned on might have made me more aware of waking up? I feel far more rested today despite feeling like I only got 4 hours of sleep at most from waking up and struggling to fall back asleep. Usually, at this time, I can't stay away from the bed because I feel like I'm going to go crazy without a nap.

SleepApnea,"Nobody suspected me of having OSA. I read about the symptoms online and after reading some stories on these subs I'm convinced that I have sleep apnea or some sleep disorder. 

I took a home sleep test. I was only able to sleep for 3.5 hours of the recorded 7.5 hours. The report said I had an AHI 11.4. After reading about HST's underdiagnosing OSA in a lot of cases I decided to get a Level 1 sleep test. 

The reports just came out and it says there's an AHI of 2.5. I couldn't sleep for an hour but the report says I had a sleep latency of 0 minutes and i was only awake for 35 minutes in the recorded 7.45 hours of data. I remember waking up after 3-4 hours and i wasn't able to sleep after that. 

I have had chronic facial pain for about 2 years now. I've seen 21 doctors so far and each one of them have said I have no issues and some have said it's just a tension headache. I'm really starting to lose it mentally. I never have the energy to do anything and I'm always sleepy. I have to take a nap in between. From the past 3-4 months i feel dizzy sometimes and I feel like I may collapse. A blood test showed that I had Vitamin B12 deficiency and I've taken injections for that. The Vertigo test said I had Vestibular migraine. 

I know for sure that this isn't a mental health issue. 2 years ago i remember taking naps at around 10.30 to 11 AM for about an hour to an hour and a half. I don't know what I did right but I woke up feeling so so good. I'm usually easily irritable but I was so carefree after those naps. I felt so relaxed. Comparing my everyday sleep to those naps tells me there's something wrong. This can't be it. I know sleep has to be better than this. 
I have been doing Yoga and that hasn't helped either.  

The doctor is friends with the sleep technician. He can access all the data recorded that night if he wants. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I've read about using different scoring criterias making a significant change in AHI. How accurate are these tests? 

Could this be UARS? RDI is same as AHI so are they measuring RERA's or no? I'm losing all faith in the medical system. 

I'm gonna be seeing the doctor within 2 days. What all should I ask him? 

Should I just use the CPAP no matter what he says and see if my quality of sleep improves?

SleepApnea,"so long story short, considering trt replacement therapy, found our correlations from that to sleep apena. my mood, irritability from day to day varies as well as my energy levels. never thought I snored and always thought I slept well. so I downloaded an app last night quick before bed to record if I do snore at all and it it seems from what the app picked up I did briefly for a min or two around 2am which is near the end of my sleeping time I wake up around 430am. You can hear that I sound super stuffy and congested in these little sound clips while sleeping, I've now noticed after listening to this that I'm always kinda stuffy throughout the day and what not. Not that I've noticed it to be a issue like I said but now I'm starting to be more aware of it and thought the day I'm always kinda stuffy I guess you could say. I want to get a sleep study now. But Is this minor stuffy congestion I guess that I've lived with we'll say undetected just thinking it's normal, actually normal? Iike for example if I breath  normal through my nose there  is no obstruction sound, but if i breath in fast I can hear that I'm stuffy congested etc which is normally how I am just wondering is this could be an issue.

SleepApnea,"I snored a lot, family members told me I'm constantly choking while asleep, and I keep falling asleep and being tired all day. So I went to the doctor, and was diagnosed with sleep apnea after doing a sleep study. Got an average of 96 episodes per hour, and less than 2 on the hospital CPAP they tested on me, a nasal pillow.

After that the doctor prescribed a CPAP machine. He didn't explain how to use it other than that it's a machine that helps you breath, didn't give me any follow up appointments, didn't tell me any of the stuff I've been reading about on this sub about exploring my options. I didn't even know there were different kinds of masks until I bought the thing, which came with a face mask (covers the mouth and nose) instead of the nasal pillow from the hospital.

The first few nights I *think* I felt different. Like I felt pretty rested compared to usual, but I also felt like I didn't get enough sleep, in a very new sensation that's hard to describe, almost like I was sleep-drunk. It might have been REM rebound but the problem is I'm not a medical expert and I have no idea how to measure my own symptoms or what to make of anything. And that ended up being a pretty common issue.

I'm a heavy mouth breather, and my mask sometimes slips, or the bottom even falls into my mouth. On this sub everyone swore by using a nasal pillow and mouth tape combo for that exact issue, so I went and bought a nasal pillow, but no sizes were comfortable for me, and I had no idea if I was using it right, the air felt like it was going so strongly and I didn't know if it was leaking or not compared to the more sealed face mask I had gotten used to. So I went back to the face mask.

It's been a few weeks since then, and I can't tell if it's actually working or not. If I'm getting a bunch of leaks, if I'm even using it correctly. I keep waking up a bit too early and find it hard to go back to sleep. And I'm starting to feel tired in the day again. The machine is only just now telling me I should start replacing filters. I have no idea how to do that, and google doesn't help me with any tutorials (it's a Yuwell machine, a brand with barely any info on it out there). I'm scared of using it now because I don't wanna inhale something dangerous or something, I don't really know what the filter is or if leaving an old one in there is a super bad idea. I getting anxious about the idea that I'm missing something obvious, if I'm doing something wrong, and research keeps giving me conflicting information. It's so hard to figure this thing out.

Should I be pursuing follow up sleep studies with my machine to see if it's actually working? Should I have done something different and super obvious that I missed out because my doctor barely filled me in? I know this is the right path, I feel like this machine did do something different, I just have to figure it out.",t2_hp0qq,0,"I have no idea if it's working, I have no idea what to do",[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,11mh7oq,True,Brother_Doughnut,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/11mh7oq/i_have_no_idea_if_its_working_i_have_no_idea_what/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/11mh7oq/i_have_no_idea_if_its_working_i_have_no_idea_what/,35901,1678331988,0,,False,1678332000,1678332000,2023-03-09 03:19:48,,,,,,,
SleepApnea,"According to my sleep study, I have very mild sleep apnea. The junior doctor at the practice told me I could try CPAP, or I could wait and test again in the future and see if it’s become more urgent. AHI 4, RDI 11, for what it’s worth.

I order the machine because I want to see if it helps me sleep. My 90 days starts the day they ship it. It takes two weeks to arrive because it’s the holidays. I have a telephonic meeting with a tech (her internet is down, winter storms). The nose mask they sent won’t work— I’m congested. So they order a full face mask.

I get it and I have 60 days left, and I need 20 days of compliance in a 30 day period (4+ hours a night). I can’t get it to work. I take off two weeks because of family emergency, then I scheduled an appointment with a tech for help. The first appointment— nobody shows. There was a glitch with the online scheduling. I set up another meeting the next week. Now the camera works so we meet virtually and she can see the mask is too big.

She orders a smaller mask. A week later, I find out it hasn’t shipped, but they’re really shipping it now.

I get the mask and I have 25 days left in my compliance period. It fits but I have a bad cold, horrible cough, can’t use the machine.

I’m sending it back because insurance won’t cover it if I don’t comply. I’ll try again some other time?

Is this the way the system is supposed to work? Would you pay out of pocket for the benefits it gives you?

I’m tempted to ask my doctor to write a new script to try somewhere else, now that I know what size mask to try.

SleepApnea,"Hi all! Just looking for some insight on how you felt before diagnosis and the process if you don’t meet the profile. Apologies for not doing a thorough search here, but I’m tired as fuck today.

I’m a 30yo F with a bmi of 22. I have a dainty little neck (too dainty??), no health issues, exercise daily (marathon runner), never smoke and only have about a beer a day. As far as I know, none of my relatives have diagnosed sleep disorders. I do have acid reflux sometimes as well as (relatively controlled) generalized anxiety disorder, but that’s about it.

Despite all those good things, I feel exhausted all the time. My partner says I snore, and I do sometimes wake up with a sore throat or dry mouth. 

I feel like I need a nap every day. Not like “Aw shucks, a nap would sure be nice”. No, like “I’m going to fall asleep on my dog’s dog bed with him for two hours because I can’t keep my eyes open.” Obviously, that’s not normal, and it doesn’t get better during periods where I’m training less. It actually gets worse, I think.

SleepApnea,"I've been struggling lately with compliance. I've been waking up choking after 20-30 minutes of actual sleep (not related to dry mouth), repeatedly throughout the night with my machine. After 2-3 instances of this, the mask comes off and I sleep without it. My sleep doctor refuses to offer any advice on adjustment of settings or another titration study and instead prescribed trazadone which doesn't even come close to remedying this issue. Without OSCAR data I'm kind of lost on where to start here. Here's what I'm using and current settings:

Machine: Luna G3
Resmed Air touch F20 FFM Size L 
Heated tubing (set to 2/5)
Humidifier (set to 5/5)
Pressure: 14/10
EPR: 3
Ramp: Off
Lab cast Mouth guard for upper teeth (to remedy pain from bruxism)
Leak rate is about 2.5L, very low 

I've also tried the p10 nasal mask, medium pillows with either a chin strap or mouth tape, and same results. Nasal congestion is minimal to none. No septum issues or anything to raise alarm from an ENT. 

I fired my sleep doctor today, and have an appointment at the Cleveland clinic in May. 

In the mean time, has anyone experienced this and found a remedy? I can't tell if I'm not getting enough air or too much, as my adrenaline is super high when I wake up and I need to get the mask off to breathe.

SleepApnea,"Hi all,

First of all I would like to say how supportive everybody in this sub is. I have been a lurker since my diagnosis (AHI 21) and have gained a lot of knowledfe from all of you.

Anyway, I received my CPAP about 3,5 weeks ago. The first weeks have been AMAZING. I felt so good. A good night of sleep felt like the most poweful drug. Personally, I did not have any issues getting used to the CPAP. It doesn’t bother me and have been able to sleep the entire night with the mask on from the first night. 

Since a few days, I have been feeling really tired, groggy, depressed. As if I had not been sleeping with my CPAP. But my AHI is less than 1 and also do not have any leakage.

It feels so bad because I now know how good I could feel, but it feels as if I’m going downhill.

SleepApnea," I recently go diagnosed with mild sleep apnea (6.3 AHI) and PLMS. My symptoms seems to be more severe than the mild diagnosis would suggest, so I pushed for, and was prescribed an auto CPAP. 

The nurse said my PLMS could be caused by the apnea, but also suggested I start taking iron supplements (don’t ask me the causal mechanism, I barely understood when she was speaking – something about the blood brain barrier). She said PLMS could create similar arousals as apnea, and affect my quality of sleep in a similar way. 

I just started the iron supplements yesterday, and I have to say, I do feel slightly more awake today. Anyone else go through something similar?

SleepApnea,"Hello!

After about 30 years of never having problematic sleep in my life, I began to develop sleep apnea symptoms (but I didn't know it at the time, just thought I was having some difficulty sleeping). Around that same time, I had begun living with my partner, who I was starting to learn was an abusive narcissist.

At first I didn't think there was any correlation, but I noticed when I visited my family (who lived in a different state) for a couple of weeks at a time, after 2-3 nights, my symptoms would completely disappear, as though my system could somehow recover when out of the stressful environment.

Unfortunately, after enough iterations of this, the apnea symptoms became permanent, and now I'm trying to fix it with CPAP and not having much luck. I've since ended the abusive relationship, but that doesn't seem to have had much effect.

Did anyone else notice their symptoms appear, while they were in an abusive relationship, or maybe just in an extremely stressful situation? Was there anything you did that helped your recovery? I'm wondering if anyone has experiences that mirror mine, or has any insight to share.

SleepApnea,"It’s a long story but I’ll try to keep it as succinct as I can.

I’m a male in my 30s. Generally fit, BMI 21, don't smoke and drink socially.

For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled with:

*  Difficulty falling asleep and easy waking. Although once I’m asleep I can stay asleep if undisturbed
*  Constant daytime tiredness even if I’ve slept over 8 hours, to the point where friends would joke about my sleepy demeanour
*  Mouth breathing and nasal-sounding voice
*  Frequent nighttime waking, SOMETIMES as if my throat was blocked up and I needed air
*  Inability to pay attention or focus, easily distractible

I don’t really snore but I’ve been told at times that my breathing at night sounds impaired or ‘odd’.

I always put my symptoms down to not sleeping enough, so I began to experiment with sleep meds. Initially Melatonin, which I liked, and then I tried my friends’ Mirtazapine (which is an antidepressant but works wonders for sleep). Unfortunately I have become dependent on the latter. Interestingly studies show it can actually drastically decrease AHI. I didn’t tell my physician or sleep consultant about this- I’m aware that it’s irresponsible but I’m ashamed about taking it unprescribed. 

I was also under ENT for chronic rhino-sinusitis. I had extremely blocked sinuses on scans. Around 3 years ago I was offered surgery (septoplasty and sinus surgery). I was hopeful about this and thought that it would fix my issues with sleep/tiredness. Unfortunately it didn’t. I feel it improved things somewhat but my tiredness and unrefreshing sleep are as bad as ever. I still use antihistamines/steroid nasal sprays/sinus rinses. 

A couple months ago my friend told me about the possibility of sleep apnea. This again got me VERY excited. I was convinced that this was the cause of my problems and that my life was about to change, especially after reading stories on this sub. 

My GP agreed to refer me to the sleep clinic and I had a home sleep test (using PolyWatch). This was with a finger sats probe, nasal cannulae and a strap around my chest to measure beathing. 

To my dismay, the results were ‘normal’. The consultant was dismissive on my follow-up call, he very briefly mentioned some form of dysfunction (possibly restriction?) and advised sleeping with 2 or 3 pillows, then quite abruptly ended the call saying everything was fine. 

I have attached the report here: [https://imgur.com/a/w9TZTYH](https://imgur.com/a/w9TZTYH) 

Note: I believe that the data on wake:sleep is inaccurate. I DEFINITELY woke up a few times in the night but according to this report I only woke up once and had largely undisturbed sleep.

Not wanting to accept the result, I ordered a private home sleep test online (WatchPat).

Again this was largely normal, report attached: [https://imgur.com/a/5pLCBiR](https://imgur.com/a/5pLCBiR) 

One thing I noticed is that my heart rate varies a lot and I can become quite tachycardic throughout the night. Also- the proportion of deep/REM sleep may be influenced by the medication I’m taking (as above). 

Given that I’m under the UK's NHS system and how dismissive the consultant was, I feel it’s unlikely that I’d be granted an in-lab study unless I forked out thousands for a private one. 

Note: I've had the basic bloods including thyroid, hormone levels etc which were largely normal (aside from subclinical hypothyroidism on one test). 

I'm now in a situation where I'm having these symptoms but with no idea as to what I could explore next. Any ideas are very welcome, but I’m starting to accept the unfortunate reality of being eternally tired.",t2_4a2o9lda,0,In DESPERATE need of advice following normal home sleep studies,[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,11lxbtp,True,sotondoc,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/11lxbtp/in_desperate_need_of_advice_following_normal_home/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/11lxbtp/in_desperate_need_of_advice_following_normal_home/,35888,1678284546,0,,False,1678284562,1678284562,2023-03-08 14:09:06,self,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mtUneUL5WP0QNJmpFE8hPog3_cvftilONUjPgENZ9FM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4de0eeeedc824db15748d05262defd625e3a9599', 'width': 1241, 'height': 1755}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mtUneUL5WP0QNJmpFE8hPog3_cvftilONUjPgENZ9FM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5d494c7ca55fae36ab5416e3029ce7618d3733ae', 'width': 108, 'height': 152}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mtUneUL5WP0QNJmpFE8hPog3_cvftilONUjPgENZ9FM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4288b9dd4cde5e4a8669330b8c8961cca11ec4df', 'width': 216, 'height': 305}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mtUneUL5WP0QNJmpFE8hPog3_cvftilONUjPgENZ9FM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=908bd5614e1d73ac6eea84f568b92ebad530ea7e', 'width': 320, 'height': 452}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mtUneUL5WP0QNJmpFE8hPog3_cvftilONUjPgENZ9FM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=366a13c971910777957043ccba8af1351072fde9', 'width': 640, 'height': 905}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mtUneUL5WP0QNJmpFE8hPog3_cvftilONUjPgENZ9FM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1e54955ee7c394b6cc3f4f8dbf45fc6070b61161', 'width': 960, 'height': 1357}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/mtUneUL5WP0QNJmpFE8hPog3_cvftilONUjPgENZ9FM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ec5133965b82615660d095cd6f7c585e942238cd', 'width': 1080, 'height': 1527}], 'variants': {}, 'id': '0tfz37kYVlg3AokKlBS6JrlfP9f0RKhOITEjtXqOJSg'}], 'enabled': False}",,,,,

I booked a sleep test and my results came back to a 4.5 AHI, which my doctor regarded as 'no sleep apnea' as the minimum he stated was 5 to be given a CPAP/treatment. But obviously 4 times an hour isnt entirely normal.

I've purchased an air purifier, tried sleeping raised on a wedge pillow, stopped eating 3 hours before bed etc - all pro sleep habits. And while i see *some* benefits i still feel no where near 100%.

SleepApnea,"Hi all, 

The internet has provided nothing with respect to this potential combo of using a device like SnoreRx while mouth taping. Has anyone tried it? Is it a thing? Was it more helpful or less than either individual approach on their own? Is it even possible?

I'm aware that PAP machines are the gold standard, yet my last sleep study 5 years ago indicated mild apnea (9 AHI). After the recommended surgical interventions (septo/tubrinite reduction), no benefit was realized. Follow-up at home study is scheduled for April. 

Current regimen that has decent - not great - results includes: 

* Neti pot
* mouth tape (3m or hostage) -
* Intake nasal dilator

Even with the above interventions, SnoreLab still records a fair amount of snoring, and unfortunately I remain perpetually exhausted.

SleepApnea,"27m, not overweight, slightly muscular. I’ve always been a really light sleeper. I do not snore (partner confirms) or dominantly mouth breathe (although, I do sometimes have a dry mouth in the morning). 

I do wear a clear grind guard for a retainer. 

Symptoms: 

1. I toss and turn and sometimes wake up with a slight headache in morning. Not sure if it’s a pillow issue causing a tension headache or not. I prefer a really shallow pillow. 

2. I’m not chronically tired during the day everyday, but I just feel as though I’m not sleeping as well as I should. And this has been the case most my life.

3. I sometimes wake up with a racing heart beat i feel like. Or I wake up maybe short of breathe feeling? It’s kinda hard to explain. 

4. I also wake up to pee sometimes 2-3 times/night and I think this relates to my dry mouth. 

5. It’s also hard for me not to turn on my side to sleep. 

6. My blood pressure has always been elevated for an unexplainable reason. A friend told me To check into sleep apnea. 


My respiration rate at night usually is between 13-14 per my Apple Watch. 

I have tried many supplements and pre bed routines. Some help, but some don’t. Nothing really solves the issue. 

Should I order an at home lofta? Are these worth it? The sleep study clinics in my area are few and far in between.

SleepApnea,"Hi all, 

So I developed sleep apnea after a bad nose surgery. It’s been 2.5 years and I still can barely breathe out of nose most of the time unless I’m propped up or in an upright position. It’s been worse in the winter because of the dryness. I keep a humidifier in my room/sleep propped up. 

I have a nasal cushion mask but still find it really hard to breathe since I don’t think the machine is able to do what’s it supposed to since my nostril is typically clogged. I keep the humidifier on my tank high but experience pooling even with all the tricks of keeping the hose cover and the machine down lower. On the few nights my nose hasn’t been clogged I don’t experience the pooling. 

My question for everyone is when you have congestion do you think your machine works as well? I’ve thought maybe I just need a full face mask verses just a nasal one…I know my situation is a little different but what is everyone’s experience with congestion and using the machine and any tips at all? I am getting so desperate I’m even debating between seeing another surgeon for a revision surgery but really don’t want to go that route if maybe either changed settings could help or a different mask?

I don’t know what my settings even are since my machine won’t let me change them and I keep my humidifier on high at 5 with the heat at 4.

I record my sleep every night and noticed a reduction right from the beginning, but it's not completely gone.

SleepApnea,"Been dealing with fatigue and needing to sleep a lot for years now.

Male 34, overweight.

I was diagnosed with sleep apnea about 3 years ago. Pressure level 9.

Got the machine and used it on and off. Never really felt a difference, so it was hard to keep at it. So I didn't really use the machine much. (There was only one week in the summer that I felt amazing and was jumping out of bed at 6am full of energy. I don't know what was unique about that week.)

A few months ago I decided I really need to take care of this.
Went for another sleep test. They put me at 13 pressure.

Got my machine and used consistently for over 3 months. Getting good scores on the machine and low AHI's (usually about 2). I even wore an oxygen monitor overnight. That night I took my CPAP off at about 630 and slept another hour. Oxygen monitor showed good levels till 630 and then the levels tanked from 630-730.

All of this seems to show the machine is doing its job.

I am still super tired and can sleep 12 hours easily.

Vitamin d was a bit low at 20, but it's now back up to 46 for some time already.
B12 is good. Thyroids are all within range.

I do take venlflaxine for over 5 years already, but I'm on a lower dose than most of those years. I used to take 225mg and now only take 150mg.

I do a moderate amount of exercise. Maybe not as much as I'm supposed to do, but I definitely do some real exercise.

Testosterone levels showed potentially low, but I don't know much about that yet. Tested total t in Jan at 140ng around 1:30pm. Tested again in Feb at 9am: 296ng total and 78 free. Tested again end of Feb at 330pm 293ng total t.

I am a walking zombie and dead tired. Any idea what's going on. Is it my sleep apnea or is it something else  I should say the level of fatigue varies throughout the year. Now it's on the worse end.

SleepApnea,"I've been taking Trazadone for a while kow to help fall asleep with my mask. I've managed it a couple of times in 5 months, but generally I just wear it for an hour then take it off and fall asleep immediately. 

I had a somatagram (with the watch and the chest sensor) at home last month and the Dr told me my events had dropped from 66 to 14, even though I wasn't able to keep the mask on for the night I had the somatagram on.

He suggested this might be as a result of wearing the mask briefly and the trazadone chilling me out. I don't really understand how that works but hey, I ain't arguing with not dying in my sleep.

But. I have been having much worse mental health recently. I have struggled with depression throughout my life but really hoped that fixing my sleep would help. I've read that Trazadone can cause depression to worsen, but I don't want to stop if it's stopping me choking.

SleepApnea,"I am 2 weeks in my cpap therapy and have a problem I need some advice on. Tried researching this and did not find any answers.

I keep taking the mask off!

I tried changing masks but I do not think it is about the mask.

I always feel like breathing without cpap is easier. It feels like inhales are strange and more effortful than normal breathing. Even at higher pressure! Exhales are even worse (btw I have cpap that turns off on exhales).

I would wear it for 2-3 hours, wake up and consciously take it off. After I take it off breathing is way easier. I feel like apart from the times I apnea breathing is way, way better without cpap. 

Not sure what to do… Should I be using bipap? Or spend some time in cpap during the day to get used to it?

SleepApnea," Hi All,

I posted this in the CPAP board but they recommended I post here as I may get better advice. 

I need some expertise:-(. I got my first CPAP machine three days ago and am so excited to no longer be a complete zombie at all times. I am wearing the device all night long. It is the Airsense 10 with a humidifier and am using the nasal mask. Despite this, for 2 nights in I am seeing a AHI of 18 and the 3rd night a AHI of 13. .:-(. with a lot of clear airway apnea’s (not sure what that means).  My sleep study showed 55 events per hour so I am guessing this is quite a bit down from that but how can I get my numbers to less than 5 events per hour?. 

Night 1: Pressure 4-14. AHI 18.67

Night 2: Pressure 4 -15. AHI 18.87

Nights 3: Pressure 8-16. AHI 13.19

I visited an ENT and I was shown to have a severly deviated septum that according to him would of made it impossible for me to nose breathe which is what I have been doing my whole life. He also said that my throat was a normal size and that sleep apnea was unlilkely to be caused by a small throat.  I've booked in surgery in a couple months and hopefuly that should fix my breathing issue.

SleepApnea,"TLDR: have some signs of sleep apnea, but unsure if it’s urgent enough to seek medical advice. I don’t have health insurance. 

My boyfriend who sleeps next to me at night recently informed me that sometimes I stop breathing for a few seconds and have a small gasp for air when I’m sleeping. I had no idea this was happening and now I’m freaked out that I have sleep apnea. He said that he’s only noticed it happening a handful of times over the last few months (although of course he’s not watching me sleep every night so it could be happening more) and that I stop breathing for 3-4 seconds at a time before having a sharp inhale. I don’t have any other signs indicative of the disorder (not excessively sleepy during the day, I don’t snore, don’t have dry mouth etc) other than I’ve had episodes of being jolted awake at night for the last year or so. I don’t feel like I’m gasping for breath or anything when this happens but my heart rate sky rockets and I feel very panicked for a few moments. I didn’t think anything of it until now that I know I have episodes of not breathing during my sleep as well. 

Based off this info, do you think it would be a good idea to bring this up it my doctor and possibly inquire about having a sleep test? I don’t have health insurance so I would be paying out of pocket for this, which is why I’m really conflicted about it.

SleepApnea,"I don’t mean “what does it do,” I mean… what’s it for? 

I have severe, complex sleep apnea, and I use a Phillips DreamStation BiPAP Auto ASV. When I got it, I was told to get Phillips’ own app for it, and counseled to get OSCAR as well. 

The thing is, I was only ever looking at either out of nervousness. I stopped after awhile, because, like… what insight is one supposed to derive from all of these different data? It probably sounds like I’m being bitchy, but I’m genuinely puzzled. 

I’ve never touched anything to do with the function of my machine, ever. The starting pressure is whatever the nurse guesstimated would work; it amps up a bit after I fall asleep. All I do is top up the water tank every night, change the filters and tubing once in a blue moon when I can be bothered, and take the machine in for required maintenance once a year. I’ve slept like a baby from the first night I used it, never taken it off at night, and never had any other issues with it — I don’t even have to push the button to turn it on, just lay back and start breathing! 😂

Am I just very lucky and atypical? Are most people having to monkey around with their machine or monitor their night-to-night sleep in some very gamified way?

SleepApnea,"For the last 2 years I have had CPAP due to 25+ hourly RDI, however my oxygen saturation never dipped below thresholds for apneas.

It wrecked my life and CPAP gave it back.

However, I have lost 20lbs (185lbs to 165lbs) over the past 6 months which reduced my RDI to 10/hour in an updated sleep study, still very bad but much improved.

My 95% pressure went from 9cm or below to 6cm or below after weight loss. This just goes to show that even if you're not heavily overweight, a few lbs can make a big difference.

With a 95% pressure of 6cm or below I thought I must be closing in on curing this damn thing, so I booked in with an ENT to see if there was anything obvious causing the issues.

Last week I saw the ENT - I'm always slightly congested and I suspected it's my nasal breathing that fails endlessly during the night rather than my throat or anything else.

The ENT confirmed I have a deviated septum (effecting the left nostril which is very constricted but also a deviated septum which effects both nostrils and contributes to congestion) - he said I also have rhinitus and prescribed Avamys which is Fluticasone Furoate.

After 3-4 days of using the spray I felt much less congestion during the day so for the past 2 nights I have tried without my machine.

The times I wake up at night my nasal passages are clear - before they would be blocked for sure, at least in one totally and the other a fair bit.

My heart rate on Fitbit remained steady with no spikes, which is unheard of if I'm not using my machine.

I feel well rested, in fact when I wake up at 3am I feel quite awake, but I make sure to go back to sleep.

I will do another steep study soon but I think I've cured this damn thing. Something I never thought possible.

Maybe the congestion alone was the issue, but maybe in conjunction with the weight loss made it possible.

SleepApnea,"After a year of trying really hard to use my CPAP, I have had to stop using it. Whilst I'm happy to try again in future if doctors are able to make any new insights into my issues, for the moment I've stopped.
I was averaging only 4hrs sleep per night with CPAP, constantly felt tired, irritable and my quality of life deteriorated to the point where everything was at risk. Also my BP spiked much higher when sleep was really poor. Worth noting that none of these symptoms, including tiredness existed before starting CPAP.
I understand the benefits of CPAP for most people, I'm not disputing this,  but for me it has a proven negative impact. 
What I'd really like is some useful resources on all the alternatives to CPAP, all the lifestyle changes I can make to alleviate OSA, mouth exercises etc. I know these might not work, but I'd like to give it all a shot and try my hardest.
Hopefully doctors will find an alternative treatment route, but for the moment if anyone has any useful resources for things I can try, then I'd really like to hear.",t2_5fs6dcsm,0,Useful resources for someone unable to tolerate CPAP,[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,11hs0lt,True,chriscov,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/11hs0lt/useful_resources_for_someone_unable_to_tolerate/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/11hs0lt/useful_resources_for_someone_unable_to_tolerate/,35797,1677911774,0,,False,1677911788,1677911789,2023-03-04 06:36:14,,,,,,,

SleepApnea,"Last July, I (47M) had an at home sleep study done.  It indicated moderate sleep apnea (I think the AHI was 25ish), and O2 levels  (88-90) lower than explained by apnea alone.

At the time, I was really against the idea of getting a machine, especially supplemented with oxygen.  Why?  I dunno... Pride, shame, whatever. So, I punted and kept delaying the followup with pulmonologist/sleep doctor.  

I finally thought to see a doc early in the school year (I teach).  Unfortunately, in mid August I contracted COVID from the petri dish of a workplace we call a school.  So I didn't see the specialist then either.  I stayed busy at work and always had an excuse not to followup.

Fall progressed and I talked to people who use the CPAP, and lurked in this forum reading your stories, I got on board with the idea of using the therapy.  In addition, my symptoms of drowsiness, headaches, and other things other people have described here all got worse.

 So In November I finally called the office for that followup.  Soonest I could get scheduled was four or five months out!  The appointment is mid-March, and I'm looking forward to it, but nervous.  I was worried that the data from July would be too old.  I called and asked if I could have an in lab sleep study, which was scheduled for late February, but was ultimately denied by insurance.

So I'm going into the visit next week with 8 month old data and no doctor visit in the interim.  

Am I likely to walk out of that visit with a prescription for a CPAP, or am I likley to have to go through yet another round of testing/followup/testing/followup/testing/followup?

I'm Using Resmed Airsense 11 Autoset.

So I'm having problems finding a good pressure. Had a titration study but the results came back inconclusive, and it's going to take me a while to get back in. I asked if I could get any of the data collected that might help me get an idea of what might work and what doesn't work, but I feel a bit stonewalled (I'm waiting to hear back from the doctor who reviewed the data to find out why it was inconclusive.

SleepApnea,"So I switched to this full face mask a couple weeks ago and I like it a lot. It’s comfortable for me and I get a good seal throughout the night .

The only issue is just about every other night, I wake to find that one of the magnet connections has become undone, causing a big leak and for me to wake up.

SleepApnea,"I have an opportunity to be implanted with a hypoglossal nerve stimulator for free through the [Osprey Trial](https://www.sleep-apnea-study.com/), but hesitating for a few specific reasons - 1) it's pretty invasive, so worried about recovery, pain, etc. 2) Aesthetics.

SleepApnea,"I have just ordered a CPAP and it should be arriving next week.  The results of a sleep study came back and advised me I have apnea.  I'm not sure how to interpret the figures but I'm taking their advice and ordering it regardless.

Mean heart rate during sleep: 103bpm

Right now I feel a mix of anxiety, excitement, and frustration.  The anxiety and excitement is probably understandable to most here.  The frustration is at the public health system and my parents for failing to take me seriously or recognize an issue.

As a child other kids would tell me I snored.  My parents said it wasn't a big deal.  I had an earlier bedtime than even my younger siblings because my parents said I needed more sleep.  I was labeled as the grumpy kid in our house.  I've also been a mouth breather all my life but I'm not sure if that has any connection.  Now in my early 40's and over the years it has ruined relationships, and almost lost me my job more than once.

I live in a country with free public healthcare and for the last 8 years I've visited 4 different doctors a total of 7 times to request testing.  They first 6 visits they said my description of my symptoms wasn't severe enough to warrant further tests.  On the last visit the doctor finally said I just barely scrape in on their criteria but they'll refer me to a specialist for further testing this time.  The specialist's offices are in another city and I needed to book an appointment over the phone first.  I made 6 attempts to book over the course of 3 months.  It immediately goes to an answering machine with instructions on how to leave a message and a general comment that ""we are very busy and will not get back to you shortly"".

SleepApnea,"Using various things to improve my sleep apnea I have been able to reduce the pressure on my ResMed AS10 from 5.8cm now down to 4.6cm and still keep my AHI &lt;1.0, RERA=0.0, 95% Flowlimit around 0.07.

Under venting seems to cause me to breath fast in the early part of the night and wake up in a panic until I take the mask off and calm down.  In order to be able to get under 5.0cm I had to modify an old P10 to increase the venting.   Does any one else have a similar experience?  How low can you go with an unmodified P10?

SleepApnea,"for context I was diagnosed by lofta with rem related apnea (5.1 AHI 19.1 RDI) I have very severe symptoms  


last week I saw a sleep specialist for the first time and was confused by some comments he made.  


\- He said he doesnt understand how my symptoms are so severe given how mild my case is (2 ahi through the night technically ). is this right?  


\- I asked if my symptoms could be caused by not getting rem sleep (due to all my events being rem). He said people dont need rem sleep to survive. that he had patients who are on heavy anti depressants who log zero rem sleep and they feel fine.  


\- I asked about possible UARS given my RDI. He said UARS is a milder form of apnea and I shouldnt be having really any symptoms to go with it. which contradicts a lot of things I found. is this accurate?  


\- I asked if I was waking up to all of my RDI events if it would be causing the symptoms. Or if all my events were RERAs if that would cause my extreme fatigue. He said no, as he has never seen RERAs cause any sort of extreme fatigue  


\- I asked if a bipap would work better in my cause given significant flow limitations (I shared my oscar data with him). He said no that I would have seen improvement with my APAP (been using two months, only one of those months consistently over 5 hours)

SleepApnea,"Have any of you had a combo of sleep apnea, GERD and digestion/bowel movement problems? 

Sorry for the long back story, but I'm kinda lost and hopefully explaining this rings a bell for someone's experience(s). I'm 34, a short 5'3"" guy and got up to about 175lbs. About 4-5 years ago I started having trouble sleeping. At first I just felt tired, like I couldn't get enough sleep. Then later on I seemed to have some weird indigestion/bloating/constipation combo. Doctors thought it was GERD but also didn't really seem to understand or know what I described as a ""bubbling"" feeling in my chest area. To me it felt like things were stuck there. That piled on and messed with my sleep. At two points, I thought it became a heart issue because I had some heart palpitations throughout the day too. The doctors I spoke to (along with blood tests and scans) showed my heart was normal however.

Roughly 2 years ago, I ended up getting diagnosed with mild obstructive sleep apnea. I got a CPAP machine but never really got fully adjusted. I started with a full mask but then switched to a nasal mask, which did help but not 100%. I'm still not getting good quality rest today.

Whatever was seemingly affecting my heart has mostly gone away now, although I still feel relatively constipated 24/7, and it takes some effort to get a bowel movement. I also still have this ""bubbling"" feeling in my chest.

The GI doc I saw recommended losing weight and getting more water and fiber. I am now down to 160 lbs, and I am getting more water and fiber, but it doesn't seem to be helping yet. I am working my way down to at least 150 lbs and hopefully that will start fixing everything else.

SleepApnea,"Hey everyone, I'm going to vent a bit and see if someone had a similar experience as mine and can give me some advice.

I'm scheduled to have a polysomnography in 3 days, and I'm feeling quite anxious about it, since my insurance covers only one. 

I have been waking up unrefreshed and having concentration problems for as long as I can remember. A few months ago, the symptoms became a bit worse and started bothering me and affecting my job quite a bit. It made me start suspecting that I might have sleep apnea like my father and grandfather from my mother's side.

I have been tracking my SpO2 and recording myself since November, and made a kind of journal in a spreadsheet to try to find why some nights are better than others. Unfortunately, it seems to be completely random.

Some nights, my SpO2 levels remain relatively stable throughout the night (e.g: [https://imgur.com/a/lIBFaGk](https://imgur.com/a/lIBFaGk) ), with only a few minor drops here and there, and could only hear myself snoring and maybe some shallow breathing in the recording. 

On other nights, however, I've noticed much more significant SpO2 drops (e.g: [https://imgur.com/a/8nXS8XF](https://imgur.com/a/8nXS8XF) ), some noticeable obstructive apneas, and much more significant shallow breathing.

Despite my efforts to find a pattern, the randomness of my sleep has left me feeling uncertain about the accuracy of my upcoming sleep study.

This has been starting to effect my new job, my manager is aware I think I have sleep apnea, but without being officially diagnosed I'm concerned that will only cover for me for so long, and I don't know if that will stretch to a 4 year waiting list. I've been spotted by my managers boss starting to lose focus/struggle to stay awake and he's mentioned it to my manager.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated,

SleepApnea,"Let me start off by saying I'm not really a ""typical"" poster as well as **I am not soliciting medical advice.**

In 2016 I was diagnosed with moderate OSA. I wasn't compliant with my CPAP mainly due to laziness. I really can't remember my energy levels then other than being certainly tired, but I was also in a really bad spot.

In 2018 I got a tracheostomy due to a throat tumor which I had for a year. From what I remember my sleep improved and after it was removed in 2019 I returned to using my CPAP for maybe a year - this was probably 3-8 months AFTER I got the trach out because I noticed my fatigue coming back.
So, CPAP usage from 2020-2021 (stopped around early fall 2021).

I stopped because it wasn't working. In discussions with my ENTs it was considered that the throat tumor I still have and its effects on my epiglottis were being forced closed due to the CPAP.
Well - I recently got seen again after another surgery And my throat looks a lot better to them and it's looking throat I've had since before the tumor was discovered in 2018. 

After a bunch of hassle and bs (don't get me started) with getting fitted for a MAD I am getting fitted AGAIN with a new practice this month. So, maybe I can start seeing improvement.

**So, why am I telling you all this?**

Honestly, just to help paint the picture. I think I was too focused on how much this tumor might be impacting me to neglect to just consider my sleep apnea is the culprit.
In 2022 I had a sleep study done PRIOR to my recent surgery and 3 years after my last one and it came back mild - great! But, how? Is it because the tumor closing my airway wouldn't register as a AHI event?

But, it *doesn't matter*.

How is it that I am progressively getting worse then? Maybe it is the sleep apnea. Now that I have a better throat it seems to be getting worse even faster.

*I, 27M am moderately healthy as I am just under 200 lbs and somewhat active.* I am getting back in the gym (I'm a new dad so that's been more important but now my child is at an age I can start making time for myself too) and I eat healthy for the most part.

Honestly, in terms of **symptoms getting worse** it also happened after having my kid even though she's been a peach so I don't know if I blame fatherhood on it but my struggles waking up in the morning have been dramatically worsened not to mention the absolute hell I go through to just get out of bed and trudge through the morning routines. I take concerta and it doesn't help enough for my other issues.

Depending on the amount of sleep I get I have brain fog all day and regardless I am always so God damn tired and can't focus or retain anything as good as I know I should be able to. 

I don't doze off but if I sit down for too long with nothing going on I find it really hard to get going. I also can't go a day without caffeine not that it helps anymore.

But that's it for the most part - how do you guys feel yourselves? Do you think my brain fog made me forget that this is indeed what untreated sleep apnea is like?",t2_11fmf6,0,What do you feel like without treatment?

SleepApnea,"Hi. I'm using a borrowed Dreamstation 1 temporarily while I wait for my first sleep study (in-lab, 3/31). I'm currently undiagnosed, suspecting UARS. I've shared my Oscar graphs and talked to folks on apnea board. I'm having a ton of flow restrictions and arousals, but my AHI is quite good. Still waking a bunch and feel terrible, though. I've been told on more than one occasion that if I do in fact have UARS, I'll need a different machine. Of course I'd need a new one regardless, due to the recall...but the point is that (from what I've heard), this machine can't treat my UARS. Which brings me to my question:  

Is it worth it to continue this treatment despite the lack of results? I assume the machine is helping me prevent apneas and hypopneas, so that's something I guess. It took me a long time to get acclimated to treatment and actually fall asleep with the mask on, and I assume that progress would be lost if I took a 2-month break. That being said, I'm wondering if the improper treatment might be problematic or at the very least, interrupting my sleep more. Help me weigh the pros and cons here??  

Info: I'm using a DS1 with nasal pillows. Started at minimum 4 max 20, gradually moved to current min pressure of 9, max 12, C-FLEX 3. My AHI recently has been less than 1. Needing a chin strap and tape to keep my tongue in place/mouth shut, and taking gas meds because I get aerophagia.

SleepApnea,"I'm new to the whole sleep apnea journey but stumbled across this article [https://writing.samsonhu.com/how-poor-sleep-drove-me-insane-and-my-long-path-to-recovery/](https://writing.samsonhu.com/how-poor-sleep-drove-me-insane-and-my-long-path-to-recovery/); and it totally changed my perspective. Highlights:

* Sleep apnea came close to ruining my life and gave me endless trouble and pain. But, astonishingly, I learned that it's one of the most common medical conditions in the general population—[up to 20% of US adults will eventually get it, and it is untreated or undiagnosed in up to 90% of cases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19186102/?ref=samson-hu). I also learned that it's a syndrome with many causes that can be physiologically challenging to diagnose and treat. And I realized that if you have it, no sleep hygiene, cooling covers, optimized sunlight,  or exercise will help until you deal with the root cause.
* As time went on, however, things were still getting worse. This time, however, it wasn't anxiety but brain fog worsening. I became more zombie-like. Absent. I would lose things constantly. I lost track of everything except the immediate present. I could only focus on one thing at a time. I was experiencing cognitive decline.
* The treatment for me was a CPAP machine, a device you use during sleep that blows continuous positive pressure into your nose and mouth. This positive pressure keeps your airway open between inhalation and exhalation, making sure you don't have an airway collapse and stop breathing. It promised a cure. But it didn't work for me. I tried this device for several weeks but always took it off after sleeping with it for an hour or two. I tried on almost every mask available, but it didn't make a difference.
* I was young, fit, and had nasal congestion. The symptoms seem to match. UARS symptoms correlate more with mental distress. Most importantly, UARS sufferers are likely to reject CPAP. The reason for this is unknown, but some specialists believe [UARS causes an overactivation of the nervous system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4608900/?ref=samson-hu) and that this over-activation makes UARS suffers likely to reject CPAP as they are too sensitive to the positive pressure.
* One huge change was my memory. While suffering from sleep apnea, I had almost no long-term memory. I would lose track of relationships and people as quickly as they left the room. But after treatment, my memories returned, and it was almost as if I was reliving the life moment by moment as they resurfaced.

Treatments he used included:

* Improving nasal breathing with drugs, devices, and surgery
* Mouth taping
* Sleep positional therapy
* Reducing acid reflux
* Allergy shots

Personally, I can't stop thinking about the idea of old memories returning. I've always had a bad memory and a change like this would be enormous for me.",t2_12qw1s,0,"How Poor Sleep Drove Me Insane, and My Long Path to Recovery [Link]",[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,11fob8s,True,affect_alien,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/11fob8s/how_poor_sleep_drove_me_insane_and_my_long_path/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/11fob8s/how_poor_sleep_drove_me_insane_and_my_long_path/,35730,1677719442,0,,False,1677719453,1677719454,2023-03-02 01:10:42,,,,,,,
SleepApnea,"TLDR: waking up 3-5 times a night usually after about 4 hours of sleep with a stuffed nose, nothing but less stress seems to help.

I’ve had a deviated septum in my left nostril my whole life, but it has never affected my sleep. I’ve always slept on my left side and never dealt with an issue like this beforeSo in august I started Prozac which gave me urinary retention which caused me to wake up 3-5 times a night to pee, and I would wake up with an extremely stuffed nose and dry mouth. I stopped the medicine after a month but I still had the habit of waking up atleast once a night with a stuffed nose. It has gradually gotten worse  since then. A typical night I’ll lose around 1-2 hours of sleep from this issue. I’ve tried almost every thing nasal related but nothing seems to give me relief. I believe this is anxiety related as it’s gotten worse as my anxiety has returned but my doctor doesn’t believe that it could be a tic. My best nights where I only wake up around once are nights where I am not very stressed, and my worst nights are when I have something bad happen that day or a big day the next day, like how I just went to work on my first day on about 5 hours of sleep. Even if I manage to squeeze in 8 hours I still feel exhausted when I wake up and not rested like I have for the past 18 years. It is affecting my memory and cognitive ability. I believe it could be circadian rhythm related aswell as the other night I woke up but my nose was not stuffed and I still couldn’t fall asleep for an hour.",t2_dcmzi8jk,0,Nasal tic ruining my sleep and life,[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,11fmz22,True,AdComprehensive7081,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/11fmz22/nasal_tic_ruining_my_sleep_and_life/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/11fmz22/nasal_tic_ruining_my_sleep_and_life/,35726,1677716078,0,,False,1677716094,1677716095,2023-03-02 00:14:38,,,,,,,

SleepApnea,"Went on a trip and forgot my CPAP. 3 nights without it and after the 3rd night I felt like a complete zombie. Almost worse than any hangover, ever. I also couldn't stop eating that day and probably, easily consumed 3-4,000 Calories just trying to stay awake.

Now, after 2 nights of having my CPAP again I feel like a new person. Before this, I knew the CPAP was helping, but I didn't know exactly how bad my life had been prior to my diagnosis and treatment. This was eye opening and I hope I never go another night without my CPAP.

If anyone out there is on the fence or having trouble adjusting to the CPAP, I recommend getting into bed as early as possible and putting it on while reading, watching TV or whatever is your pre-sleep ritual. Once you get used to it, you'll never look back.

Also, I have tried all of the nasal attachments and the nasal pillow (the one with the prongs that go in your nose) is the winner for me. Big difference in sleep quality with that vs the cradle.

SleepApnea,"Made a throwaway to not tie myself to my main account. I wake up, every morning and have for years, in this weird state. Pretty much since teenage years, I always thought I just liked sleep more than the average person, turns out, sleep apnea. I thought CPAP would be faster, and I've accepted that its not. I'm making changes to help with it, but I want to ask about waking up while exhausted, maybe others relate.

I'm not trying to make excuses, but I understand myself sort of. It's like there's two versions of me. The one that's been awake for 30 minutes, understands I have to get up, as soon as the alarm goes off, otherwise I could lose my job, and then I can't pay rent, and then I go homeless. The other version of me exists when I wake up. That one, isn't dumb, but there's that fog I guess most of us are familiar with. That version, insists practically every morning, that it's okay to turn off the alarm, and lay in bed for 1-2 minutes, and then I fall asleep, and since there's no alarm, I am late for work, and eventually, lose my second job. 

There's advice like ""just shower in the morning"". That's useless though. That version of me, isn't interested in staying up, and would just say: ""I can lay in bed for 1 minute before the shower"". Not being exhausted would help, but apparently that's going to take an unknown amount of time. When I spend the night at people's homes, I've had them wake me up, and not wanting to be a bad guest, I ""got up"", so they could go back to bed since I was the only one that had to be up that early. Guess what, I went into the bathroom, and took a nap, that time was fine, and the friend didn't find out, but I hope it paints a clear picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really not trying to sound impossible, I want advice, because I've gotta get back to working a second job. I can't keep waking up at 2PM+. I just don't want people to waste their own time and get frustrated by giving me advice that will be like the shower idea. I've tried the puzzle apps, I solve them, and go back to bed, or I just turn my phone off. The only thing that really works is having someone wake me up, and not let me go back to bed, I haven't found that person and gotten them to stick around yet.

SleepApnea,"After two surgeries and three machine trials I’ve just finally gotten my own machine, it seems to be working great and I’m really happy with how it’s impacting my sleep so far. I even lucked out and got one with wifi, which I was pleasantly surprised at. They’ve also updated the pillow mask vent to not blow cold air all over my arms which is great!

My only issue is that I want direct access to my data and I can’t work out a way to get it. I know how to access the clinical menu, but even then I can’t find out all the things I want to know. 

I’m not even sure why a lot of the important settings are hidden in the clinical menu. It’s not that hard to understand once you’ve used the machine for a while (I have already had several trials with this machine), and if I want to adjust something like the max pressure or EPR I don’t want to have to call up a specialist every time. 

The bit of info I’d really like is what the max pressure reached on a given night was. I can only seem to access an average for the past month, which isn’t really helpful since the first night I took the mask off before I even went to sleep as the EPR was too low and uncomfortable. So my pressure didn’t even ramp but is still counted in the average. Second night it came off after an hour and last night I finally was used to it and kept it on all night.

I’ve been reading this [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5915305/#!po=50.0000) and trying to analyze and comparing my flows with epiglottis induced flows in there and why I’m not doing better with CPAP and still waking up several times every night and not getting enough of deep sleep, waking up usually after the first 2.5-3.5 hours of sleep, and probably a lot of arousals and only light sleep afterwards until morning. Besides, I’ve tried to sleep without CPAP and I actually had longer duration, like 4-5 hours sleep duration before waking up, but with higher blood pressure, of course, presumably because of O2 desaturation from not using CPAP.
I’ve been diagnosed with OSA that consists of only Hypopneas and RERAs, and A LOT of arousals, which probably caused by UARS in my understanding. I have chronic nasal congestion due to septal spurs and I’ve always been a mouth breather, with occasional nasal breathing throughout the night when it’s not fully congested (I’m class 3 on Friedman Tongue Position Classification). And I also feel like when I’m forced to breath through the mouth due to congestion, that’s when the trouble seems to be more severe, especially after that first awakening I mentioned.

I'm really at my wits end with my insomnia, I'm 25 years old and can't understand how I could have OSA at this age, especially since I'm a thin build. (I do have a recessed jaw though which my doctor picked up). I have a sleep study booked in April and I see my specialist again in June, but I wonder if I should chase another clinic for an earlier appointment. This is honestly living hell.

SleepApnea,"About a year ago I had surgery on my nose to open up my airways. I had mild obstructive sleep apnea for a long time. This surgery seemed to correct the problems I was having with snoring and waking up repeatedly. 

Cut forward to the summer, my sleep problems are getting worse again. In September I got the flu and I started waking up multiple times per night. Sleep did not improve even weeks after recovering from it. 

In December I got some kind of virus. It lasted a month, and it made it impossible to sleep. My airway would totally collapse, and it would not open. So I would suffocate as soon as I fell asleep. Eventually I was blacking out during the day, and still wouldn’t sleep for more than 5 minutes. Wound up being hospitalized because I basically became delirious. They had no clue what was wrong with me. Gave me a weird sleeping pill (trazodone) which helped, not sure how it helped, but it did, at least temporarily. 

I recovered from the illness but still couldn’t sleep. Was waking up at least once a night gasping for air. 

Now I’m sick again with something else, and it’s getting worse. Waking up several times during the night and having trouble breathing.

I have absolutely no idea why this is happening. It’s worse than it’s ever been. Why would it be getting progressively worse? I have not gained weight, nor have I changed my diet. I’ve actually lost weight since the summer.

Hi All,

If anyone is in the market for a travel CPAP I have done a lot of research and the consensus seems to be that the Breas Z2 auto and the ResMed AirMini are the best right now in terms of quality/sound. I personally just started using a CPAP but need one for a long trip I am headed to where I will be in a house with thin walls and light sleepers. I finally chose the Z2 as I like that it has an optional battery pack that I can take camping and can use any mask out of the box, and that is appears to be quieter than the AirMini.

Every site has this CPAP for $799 and that was pretty pricy considering I just dropped $1K on the AirSense 11, but I did find that [insurancecoveredcpap.com](https://insurancecoveredcpap.com/) had it for $529 with no insurance. Savings of $270.

I was skeptical that this was a scam so I checked BBB and reseller ratings and the results were mixed, but then I found that this was a Medsource company which have in store locations in a few states. I ordered with my CC just in case it was fraud but low and behold their Customer support emailed me for my prescription after a few days and I just got the device today. It's brand new and I will give it a test run tonight.

So when the sleep doctor came back with the sleep study I needed to under-go a simple at home test kit that they mail out to me, not in a lab. I was quoted \~$800 for the sleep study and then another $200 for processing and handling fees. What irked me more is they told me that the sleep study happens only on one night (they don't collect over a few days), and if there isn't good enough data then I'd need to be brought back and do the sleep study in a lab which would cost even more. So even the basic at home test would run me over $1k, which makes me think that I might be better off just skipping the doctor diagnosis and try buying my own CPAP machine.

Many patients go the extra mile/**mask**! See picture above. In addition to the CPAP filter that they use and replace regularly,  they mask over their CPAP machine's air intake, with a Surgical Mask that they replace regularly. They have ""gone the extra mask"" like this for years, without incident, for 2 reasons.  

1. Some want to save money, by replacing CPAP filters more sparingly, without [adverse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect). They reckon that a surgical mask can defend against particulates as a first layer that shall lessen the amount of particulates to be filtered by the CPAP filter, therefore shall lengthen each CPAP filter's lifespan.

SleepApnea,"In OSCAR, it looks like the default behavior is that if machine usage is tagged to the date the sleep period STARTED on. 

I dislike this for the main reason that everything else I use ends up tagging the sleep data to the day the sleep period ENDS on. Also, I'm rarely asleep before midnight, so even stuff that isn't grouped to a particular sleep period ends up being on the correct day, if we regard sleep periods as belonging to the day they END on. 

Is this something that a user can select to change? I don't want to change any of the date stamps or otherwise mess with clocks to give intentionally false information. That will make correlating much too difficult. I just want to fix the display?

SleepApnea,"Greetings, SleepApnea group!

In this forum, I've been seeing a lot of posts with comments like ""no one is talking to me"" and ""I have questions that no one seems to be able to answer."" 

Well...this post goes out to all of YOU :). Welcome to the adventure!

The culture and climate of Sleep Medicine is complex, roiling, and vast, sculpted by many competing forces, many of which have nothing to do with you. In our current climate, it is very difficult for any one provider to get their hands around it, much less explain it.

Thusly flow the unanswered questions!

I recently posted an [essay/cartoon combo](https://www.empoweredsleepapnea.com/daves-notes/silent-movie-what-we-dont-hear-is-hurting-all-of-us) that discusses this difficult issue, along with guidance as to what you can do about it to prepare yourself for the journey.

(Hint: it's all about empowering yourself with *knowledge*, available free to everyone through our cool [PODCAST](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/empowered-sleep-apnea/id1643770403)).

Seekers, take courage. Empowerment is at hand.

I hope this helps :)

Kind mojo and safe travels,

SleepApnea,"This isn't an original question since I see two other posts close to mine in recent days here but I thought I'd throw my desperation out there into the ether.

For the past 20 years I've struggled mightily with fatigue and daytime sleepiness. I also have depression and anxiety so I was always told that it was due to being depressed.

I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 2/1 via at home test with mild to moderate apnea (around 7 events an hour on side, 15 on back). I got a Resvent iBreeze about two weeks ago and have been using it since then with no improvement in symptoms. In fact, I think I feel worse--I've had days where I'm barely functional due to sleepiness. I got used to the machine with little problem and can use it for the full night. It says I'm having 3 to 4 events per hour now.

My prescription is, I believe, 4-16. Unfortunately.my machine doesn't seem to be compatible with OSCAR.

The crappy part is that I started on a new antihistamine before the CPAP and had two wonderful, energy-filled days, so I know it can be achieved.

My questions: 

Can you assure me that it does indeed get better?

I just got my yearly replacement mask and am wondering if anyone is out there in need of the S or M sized nasal cushions? I use the L and have no use for the others, ideally we swap and both win.

SleepApnea,"My sleep apnea is classified as ""mild"" but it happens almost entirely in REM sleep, so I'm told that makes it more serious. Certainly it was having some pronounced effects--I was never that tired during the day, but there were mornings when I really did feel run over by a truck after waking up. I've finally gotten used to the CPAP and used it most nights the past thee weeks for at least 4 hours and recently more like 6 to 8 hours. I haven't noticed much difference yet, except just being able to sleep longer and not having those occasional wake-ups with a bad headache, etc. I know this isn't too unusual, some people get fast improvement, some people get it gradually. But I'm wondering if the REM element might inherently take longer to heal from, since it's not so much overall body fatigue as (presumably) complex brain stuff.

Reasons for study:

Hypertension N Diabetes N Other heart disease N

  
Findings:  
exhibited fair sleep architecture throughout her home diagnostic sleep study. She had a sleep efficiency of  
73.2% with a prolonged sleep latency of 34.4 mins. REM proportion was reduced. Sleep was predominately in lateral  
positions and supine REM was not seen.  
Rare respiratory disturbances were noted with an AHI of 2.7/hr \[Normal &lt; 5/hr\], 5.0/hr whilst supine and 4.1/hr in REM.  
Obstructive events were predominately hypopnoeic in type, worse in REM and whilst sleeping supine. These events  
were associated with an average oxyhaemoglobin saturation of 97% with a nadir saturation at 86%. Average saturation  
during the study was 97%. The desaturation index was normal at 1.0 events/hr \[Normal &lt;5/hr\].  
Mild snoring was observed throughout the night. ECG normal sinus rhythm was observed throughout the study with a  
baseline heart rate of 75.1 bpm.  


Conclusion:  
There was NO evidence of significant sleep anoea (AHI = 2.7/hr) observed during this study. The arousal index was  
within normal limits and oxygenation was relatively well preserved.  
Recommendations:  
1. Consider other causes for the patient's symptoms, particularly if tiredness and/or sleepiness are present (e.g.  
anaemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, iron deficiency, medications).  
2. General measures of weight reduction, sleep hygiene optimisation, and avoidance of alcohol and  
sedatives should be implemented.  
3. If clinical suspicion for a primary sleep disorder remains high, referral to a sleep physician is recommended  
assessment for alternative sleep disorders (e.g. idiopathic hypersomnia)",t2_mxf6cpxh,0,sleep apnea results normal but i gasp for air as i am almost asleep and wake up feeling as if i held my breath. confused...,[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,11bt509,True,greentealeaf2412,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/11bt509/sleep_apnea_results_normal_but_i_gasp_for_air_as/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/11bt509/sleep_apnea_results_normal_but_i_gasp_for_air_as/,35594,1677352749,0,,False,1677352763,1677352763,2023-02-25 19:19:09,,,,,,,

SleepApnea,"Around 10 years ago, I (23 M), began sleeping on my side to try to reduce snoring (I've been told I snore in my sleep). I have been sleeping ok on my side every night, but often find myself drooling (could suggest a mouth breathing issue(?)). Every now and then, I attempt to sleep on my back to see what would happen but it's always the same outcome - just as I am about to fall asleep, some part of my mouth/nasal cavity collapses and I begin to snore, waking myself up just as I am about to fall asleep. It's the worst thing ever and it fully prevents me from sleeping on my back. I just tried mouth taping to see if I could fall asleep on my back but no that did not eliminate the issue, suggesting that the snore is nasal. Occasionally, when I am ill with a sore throat or any inflammation, the snore will happen when I am sleeping on my side too and I would not be able to sleep. I have not seen a doctor for this yet, but wanted to ask if anyone has experienced anything similar or know more about what this issue could be. I also have year round chronic allergies that seem random and every 2 weeks or so I have a day where I am sneezing and have a runny nose, the only cure being if I sleep and reset. Not sure if that's a separate issue from my sleep issues or linked somehow.

SleepApnea,"Hello all.

I've got a weird one.

I've been using an APAP after having an AHI of between 12-21 across 3 different home studies, alongside an RDI about 5-10 points higher each time. So a mild, a mild-moderate severe RDI in one study.
(I was trialling MAD once so I retested with it- did not improve)

However- I just did an in lab sleep study. RDI of 5, AHI of 4, with a high arousal index of 24, however not related to respiratory effort, or limb movement (spontaneous).

During my home studies, lowest o2 Saturation across all 3 was 86% - which I believe is not good.

During the lab study, it was lowest 91%.

The home study was done by a company that sells CPAPs. Used a reliable Philips device for the tests. In lab company also sell CPAPs.



Where do I go from here? I cannot afford another lab study, and I am seriously perplexed- I was seeking out huge $ jaw surgery and have been hating my PAP machine for 2+ years, just to find out this?

SleepApnea,"So as the title says, I just got diagnosed with Central Sleep Apnea.

I believe Ive been dealing with this for 2 years. I thought for the last year I was waking up every two hours because of bladder issues.

Well I had a sleep study confirming Central sleep apnea that didn't respond to the CPAP.

I had a 2nd sleep study last week that was done using a bipap ASV. Apparently that helped they said.

The first study I was in NREM 1 80% of the time and NREM 2 20%( NREM 3 &amp;  REM both 0%)

My sleep latency was 60% then with an AHI of 74.

My 2nd study I never hit NREM3, but I did get into REM 20% of the time and my latency was over 88% with an AHI of 8.

Well I ended up passing out at a Starbucks 3 hours later from like 1pm and then went in my car and slept for an additional 6 hours. This made me think that the bipap didn't work.

How do you all deal with sleep apnea?

I'm a recovering opioid addict and being able to nod off at a moments notice would have sounded like a dream to me back in the day, but it's really made my quality of life nil. I sleep through everything and I'm sleeping upwards of 17hours on days I don't have things set in stone.

SleepApnea,"I just got out of a frustrating appointment where it was obvious my doctor didn't believe me, so I thought I'd try here and see if anyone else had a similar experience.

I'm 42, I've been diagnosed with sleep apnea, and I have mild asthma. Mild as in that unless I have an infection of some kind or after exercise I almost never have to use my inhaler.  I have a steroid inhaler I'm supposed to take at the start of any cold/flu/etc, and I have a rescue inhaler. I'm going into this detail to say, 99.9% of the time, my asthma doesn't bother me.

After a while of using my CPAP without trouble, last year I complained to my doctor that within two to three hours of using my CPAP, I would wake up coughing, wheezing (with a watery feeling in my lungs, not a tight feeling), and feeling like I can't breathe. They adjusted my pressure and my humidity, and when that didn't work, they told me to try it during the day and see if I could figure it out. I couldn't, and I was frustrated with their lack of ideas, so I set the CPAP aside for...too long, I know. 

Recently, I thought I'd try it again. I cleaned the thing out, changed everything, the whole bit. Same thing happened. After two to three nights of waking up like that I stopped using it. 

Today I went in and the respiratory therapist was honestly a little insulting. She suggested I try holding the mask near my nose to get used to it, then start resting with it five to ten minutes a day and go from there. I explained to her that I had no problem with the feel of it or anything- it was simply this experience that was making me not use it. No good.

The doctor had no better ideas and told me that maybe if I couldn't get the hang of it, I should just stop using the machine. He adjusted my pressure and humidity and told me to try a different mask. He did say to call them if it didn't work. 

I know I need to use my machine. I've developed heart problems in the last year or so and I know the apnea isn't helping. I'm waking up with a racing heart, headache, and feeling like I can't breath, sometimes two or three times a night. I know I need to use it, I don't want to just quit.

SleepApnea,"Okay hear me out. I need some thoughtful opinions here. I am a CDL Class A truck driver. I'm 27 years old, 5,6 and about 210 pounds. 9 months ago, I went to my general physician and requested a sleep study. I was sent to my local sleep center. The results came back as 5 events per hour. I do not remember my AHI right off hand. The nurse called me back after the results were reviewed, and wanted to put me on a CPAP. At that very same time, I was in the middle of a transition of employment going through the pre-orientation process. Literally the same week. 

I responded to my nurse that no, I will be employed by a company (that of which I will not name) that has their own sleep apnea program and that I would just take my results to them and let them provide me equipment at no cost to me. (GREAT right?! Everything sounds great.) 

I arrive at orientation for said company, and produce the results from my own sleep study. They say well, your events per hour are so low (5) that we could probably keep you from our own sleep program. (At this time, Unbeknownst to me of how much gravity and absolute control the federal government AND Employer has over you when you ARE diagnosed with sleep apnea.) In response, I said no, I would love to take another test. Well, to my surprise. their same exact brand At Home test came back with results of 35 events per hour. Meaning I have Severe Sleep Apnea. which is what I was diagnosed with, through an email. I never even have met the sleep center coaches that have called me throughout the past 9 months reminding me that I am out of compliance. 

which leads me to the purpose of this post. In 9 months, I have not been able to use the sleep apnea machine for more than 4 hours a night. Which will keep you in compliance per DOT regulations. I have been cheating the system by either wearing it while I am driving. Putting the hose down into a hot water bag from CVS that will then basically act as an artificial lung. ( of which I was called out by the elusive sleep coach. I had perfect usage, but the events didn't match up. as they were at absolute 0.) 

I say ALL THAT, to say THIS.

Today I got a call from my safety department of my employer to tell me that I am on a Final Warning for under compliance Sleep Apnea usage. Because I have went several days without turning the machine on (with the bag filling with air) allowing my usage levels to drop below the required 70%. 

The question: WHY AFTER 9 MONTHS, AFTER TRYING MANY DIFFERENT MASKS, PRESSURES, HOSE TEMPS, HAVE I NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADJUST TO THIS CPAP MACHINE IF I HAVE SEVERE SLEEP APNEA. 

AM I REALLY IN THE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO IT JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR? 

THIS IS EFFECTING MY LIVELIHOOD. WHICH HAS LED ME TO FORMULATE A RISKY PLAN. 

If I call my general physician back and demand to order another at home sleep study, and just let my wife wear it. How would they ever know that I didn't wear the test? We weigh the same, she sleeps great (BY THE WAY, SO DO I WITHOUT THE MASK, IM NEVER TIRED UNLESS IVE JUST STAYED UP SUPER LATE) She doesn't snore very very loud, and sometimes I don't either. 

If the at home tests only monitor oxygen levels and your heartbeat and decibel levels. 

How would they really be able to know that I didn't wear the test? 

All I need are the results to say no sleep apnea. then its gone forever for me. 

Completely off my medical card. 

please, give me your thoughtful responses.

SleepApnea,"I did an at-home sleep study through a dentist and they said it confirmed what I'd long thought -- moderate sleep apnea. This dentist promotes as a provider of ProSomnus mandibular advancement device. However they told me things like ""unfortunately your medical insurance (they work with a doctor, they say) is high deductible and out of network"" and that I'd need to get all kinds of approvals and such. I told them I was familiar with deductibles and to please just tell me what the cost is. There was some more hawing. Finally they said it was $6,500 plus another $800 for some kind of scan. I had researched as best as I could and was expecting more like $1,600-$1,800. What is your experience with costs of these devices? Why is the cost so hidden? To my knowledge the dentist does a mold of your teeth and a special-equipment throat scan, sends to the lab. Doctor kept in the loop to keep things on the medical side of billing. Lab manufactures (probably a machine with your teeth/throat info. plugged in). I know I'm simplifying. But $7,000?!?!

I have few details about her situation, but will update as possible. My aunt was diagnosed with sleep apnea a few months ago. Her symptoms include waking up abruptly in the middle of the night with really high blood pressure and other trouble sleeping. 

She started using a CPAP machine a few weeks ago and found that she is still waking up with even higher blood pressure. She's had to go to the ER twice in the past week. 

I don't know what her CPAP machine is set to or any other details about her situation, but has anyone heard of something like this? Or had any experience with something this?

SleepApnea,"Started this journey a couple years ago. Had my first machine taken away because I didn’t meet the hours but they didn’t care I had cancer and couldnt use it because the chemo side affects made it hurt to use. (Kept the Airfit F20) 

So last fall I finally went to get prescription again and doc said I had to do test again for insurance. Test would have been 4 months out so I told her my sleep apnea didn’t cure itself in 1 year and that was ridiculous. If she felt I had it give me prescription and I’ll buy it myself. 

The couple weeks I did use the first machine the full face mask was just constant leaks. I didn’t care about straps or anything. Nothing bothered me about it other than the air leaks blowing into my eyes and around my face. I tried looses/right I just couldn’t find a way to not have annoying leaks. So this time I got the F30. It’s a lot better than the 20 but I still get leaks around the chin and mouth. I still got decent scores as far as leaks go but I just can’t stand that feeling of the air leaks. Next I tried P10 and Bleeps. I love these two the most. I switch back and forth depending if I get sore nose. 

The problem I’m having doesn’t happen every night but happens more often now which is the mouth leaks. I can’t use tape because my beard and a strap won’t help because my mouth doesn’t really open. I end up waking up after 2-3 hours with air blowing out my lips. Is my airway completely closing? How can I determine something like that. I have to get a card and put it in my machine (resmed 11) so I don’t currently have any numbers to show. Does the machine have anything saved it it or does it only start saving when card is in?

SleepApnea,"Like the title says, last night was my first night using the CPAP. My sleep study AHI is 78.6. I have a full face mask and it was awkward, and that's an understatement. I felt like I didn't actually sleep well. I laid there trying but didn't actually sleep much at all, it was so weird.  A light sleep similar to when  I was a new mom, any little thing woke me up and never actually got into a deep sleep.

The mask felt super tight, but when I loosened it air leaked so I tightened it back up. It was difficult to get comfortable, and twice the pressure felt like someone turned a leaf blower on forcing so much air I had to rip the mask off and turn the machine off and on again.

The machine did say I had a solid wear of 7 hours, and only 2.8 episodes, so I guess that is good? But that 7 hours I feel wasn't spent ""asleep"".

1. Does this happen to anyone else?

SleepApnea,"[Sleep study results](https://i.imgur.com/5lFmaZS.png)

I got Resmed Air Sense 11, two tubes - one with temp control, and a Resmed Airfit nasal pillow P30i. All the settings I can access is set to auto. Ramp auto, Climate auto, temp tube auto, and mask set to pillow. The pop when it's starting up after I put on the nasal pillow says 5-15. I've tried only the temp control tube so far. 

There's my sleep study if anybody is interested. So the first night I got the machine I actually fell asleep, woke up a few times throughout the night but was able to fall right back asleep. 

Now it's the second night with it and I'm up right now at 3:19AM. I tried falling asleep for like 4 hours. It started with breathing hard, and when I would exhale I wouldn't be able to fully exhale. It's pretty frustrating. 

Gonna call the vendor later on and see if they can adjust the settings. What gets me though is I actually fell asleep multiple times last night.

Any suggestions or things that I can try now would be much appreciated.

SleepApnea,"I've been recording and analyzing my sleep using Audacity for a while. Thanks to this, I discovered that I have some obstructive apneas and heavy breathing (partial airway obstruction?) at different points in the night, and I'm going to have an in-lab sleep study in 10 days.

I also found that I tend to move a lot when I snore. I noticed that after snoring for a while, I make a louder or heavier snore, which is often followed by tossing and turning. Sometimes, I even make noise or talk.

I'm curious if it could be considered an arousal.

SleepApnea,"Hello! I’ve had my APAP since 2021. It’s a Phillips DreamStation 2. I got it after doing an at home sleep study. I used it for a few months but stopped as I felt absolutely no difference between using it and not. I started again in July 2022 hoping that might have changed somehow… but no. I scheduled a hospital sleep study (a titration one, not sure if that’s how they all are?), and the results came back a few days ago. The nurse said something about maybe needing a BiPAP, but today when I was contacted by the company supplying them I was told they were going to give me a CPAP with the pressure set to 7. I’m so confused. Why would they do this if the one I already have doesn’t work? I am also confused why I was told initially I would need a BiPAP. So I was referred here to hopefully get some help figuring out the data that was run through OSCAR.

For some reason it’s only showing recorded data from August 2022 through October 2022 though. I’ve been using it since July 2022 fairly consistently. Some nights I wake up and find I’ve ripped it off at some point in my sleep. But yeah… I’m so lost.

People have said, it can take time to feel better.

But here is the confusing part.

For a few nights I switched to a mandibular device (which brings the jaw forward) and it definitely helped.  I slept better and felt better the next day.

It's confusing because it seems the C-PAP machine would definitely be a more effective device.

So can you help me make sense of this.

Why would C-PAP improve my breathing (27 down to a 2), but get no results.

And an arguably less impactful device (the mouth guard) get me better results?

SleepApnea,"Hey everyone,  

I wanted to share [some of my OSCAR flow rate graphs zoomed in](https://imgur.com/a/eXngU7R), because I'm not sure if my flow rate waves are normal. I know y’all can’t diagnose, but can you tell me if these look normal? I believe I read somewhere that flat tops on your flow rate indicate flow limitations, but I could be wrong (I am very new to all this). I'm wondering if I'm having more flow limitations causing RERAs than what is being flagged in OSCAR. I’ve been using a borrowed CPAP/APAP for a few weeks now and am doing this all on my own as I’ve not yet been diagnosed with anything. Just trying to get some relief while I wait for my sleep study on March 31! Note: my mouth tends to open when I fall asleep, causing air to rush out of my mouth and wake me up. Not sure if that's what we're seeing in these charts, or what. I am using Dreamwear nasal pillows with a makeshift chin strap and started using Myotape recently to combat this, and these additions are helping me to actually sleep with the mask on. But I'm still waking up more than I'd like, and I want to find out why.    

Background info: My doc and I have suspicions of some kind of sleep disordered breathing issue (possibly UARS). I’m a relatively petite (more on this later) 37 y/o female with ongoing severe fatigue, frequent insomnia, brain fog, intermittent tachycardia and heart palpitations, etc. My ENT noted a small jaw and macroglossia at my first visit last month. I've noticed some weird issues as I fall asleep in the last year or so, but they’re hard to describe, as I’m unaware of what’s happening until I've fully woken up. But when I do, I have an adrenaline rush/increased heart rate and it makes it really hard/impossible to fall back asleep. I said *relatively* petite earlier because my BMI was like 19.5 a few years ago and now it’s 24.5 (normal but approaching overweight). I’ve changed nothing about my dietary intake or physical activity, so I can only assume my weight gain is related to the crappy sleep I’ve been getting for years...

SleepApnea,"I was diagnosed using an at-home sleep study that was mostly just a glorified fingertip pulse oximeter. So the prescribing doctor would have no way to know what pressures would affect me in what way. So they sent me a Resmed 10 APAP with factory default settings. Fine. 


It turns out, the 4 cm of pressure minimum is enough to make my side-lying breathing fairly smooth. But on my back is a problem. I get into a once-per-minute apnea cycle that starts with a few deep breaths, that gradually taper off, then 25 seconds of apnea, then start over. During this, my heart rate goes from 55 gradually up to 70 or 75, then drops back down to 55. The heart rate increase lags the intense inhales by just a few seconds, of course. Anyway, it's REALLY repeatable. And it doesn't seem to be affected very much by the pressure. This goes for pressures ranging from 4 cmH2O up to 16 cmH20. I usually wake up around14-ish, so it's not really feasible right now to study my breathing above that pressure while I'm asleep. 

I decided to try to use the Resmed 10 and my pulse oximeter to do my own titration study because I don't want to drop the cash on doing the titration study right now. 

What I've done is this: set the ramp period for 45 minutes, set the start and end values of the ramp, and set the normal operation range for the APAP mode after that, and then put the mask on, and intentionally fall asleep on my back.  

What I've found after doing a few of these ramp-titration studies is that one time, as the pressure increased from 6 to 9, I was doing that once-per-minute apnea cycle up until the pressure got to 8.2, at which point the apnea cycle stopped. It restarted later a while after the APAP mode took over, though, around 11 cmH2O. 

Then a few nights later, I had set the machine to just stay at a flat 4 cmH2O pressure, and that resulted in the apnea cycle not happening. 


The thing is, that basically every time I've been on my back, the apnea cycle starts. And for the last month, I've been using a pressure setting of minimum 6.4, maximum 10. And never in there (when I was on my back) did the apneas stop. 


So to recap: after just under 2 months of use, almost every time I'm on my back I get into a once-per-minute apnea cycle. During this period, my pressures range from 4 to 16 initially, then 6.4 up to 10 after I decide I'm tired of the machine waking me up with a really high pressure. Then I try to study the effect of the pressures, and I find one time that around 8.5 the apnea cycle stops. But it restarts later at a higher pressure. Then a few nights later, at 4cm the apnea cycle stops. 

It makes me think that, for me, the concept of ""turn up the pressure until the airway stays clear"" just does not work when I'm on my back. Like, it doesn't even help. At all. And it makes me a LOT less interested in dropping a lot of cash on getting a professional titration study, if the results are going to be basically meaningless the next time I go to sleep. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated, especially thoughts about how I might be misunderstanding the point of titration studies, or how I'm misunderstanding the repeatability of such studies, or on how that just can't be mimicked using a regular CPAP machine.

Thoughts like ""just stop sleeping on your back"" are not really what I'm after at this time.

SleepApnea,"Hi all, 20F. I have had an extremely dry mouth and insomnia for years but about a month ago I suddenly began experiencing EXTREME fatigue and sleepiness, to the point of falling asleep whilst driving on the motorway, I was concerned so I went to A&amp;E my labs are normal. Keep in mind I suffer from OCD so I get high anxiety sometimes but I was managing it quite well until around this time, when it suddenly skyrocketed and I was very worried for my health. I began getting some neurological symptoms including ""internal"" vertigo which has lasted for weeks and does not improve or worsen when my anxiety fluctuates. The past 2 days, I have been quite short of breath. I have also had severe acid reflux. I have noticed some incidents the past weeks of waking in the middle of the night choking. 


I am skinny but I have always had real bad problems breathing through my nose and had to get tonsils/adenoids removed because it was so bad. My chin is recessed, I think from mouth breathing. 


I did get my doctor to refer me to sleep, she also referred me to neurology. I guess my question is, does this sound like sleep apnea? My appointments with specialists are still a while out and this is absolutely wrecking my quality of life. The shortness of breath is also concerning me as it's getting worse and I don't want to go back into the clinic because that will make the OCD worse.

I've been having trouble with OAs and having clusters. I started wearing a good 3.5' soft cervical collar and sleeping on my side but I still get AHIs below 5 and clusters here and there. So I decided to experiment by sleeping while sitting upright on my bed. I slept pretty well and I awoke to some surprising results. It's probably the best my OSCAR charts have ever looked, but I'm not sure if it's ideal yet. I don't feel much different but I'm sure if it continues this way I'll be sure to feel better eventually.

I scored a 48 but feel like I was expecting treatment sooner but now I gotta wait a few months for anything to get to me and I can't keep up with my school work and I have bad anxiety at school. I've been clawing for any kinda dopamine or escape I can last few months feeling miserable and I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. I'm scared of asking and talking about help since I feel like whenever I try to talk to anyone I freeze up and say something completely different than what I wanted to say and I haven't felt like me at all and I go home get yelled at about my grades and I don't feel safe anywhere. If I didn't have my dog now I think I mightve went off to find a bridge by now.

SleepApnea,"After what I've experienced over the last 1.5 years, and with sleep study results today - I fear my sleep apnea, and hypoxia, is going to kill me.  Since November of 2021, I've been hospitalized twice (and could easily have been several more times) after ""events"" in which I have seizures in my sleep, urinate and defecate on the bed, vomit everywhere, lose total awareness of consciousness for up to 48hrs, move things around the house strangely among other behaviors, and eventually find myself ""coming to"" in terrible shape (tongue-bitten, nose/throat dried out, feeling like I've been through hell, bruises, teeth chipped, etc).  The incidents are accompanied by weeks of extreme brain fog, loss of memories for weeks prior to the incident, trouble with balance, etc. ... very scary stuff for a 41 year-old man.  After several 'red herring' medical issues that needed to be evaluated (I have a shunt in my head from hydrocephalus, I take seizure meds for bipolar disorder, and there was suspicion I had epilepsy), a sleep study was ordered with some suspicion that these incidents may be the result of hypoxia.

The sleep study revealed I have ""severe obstructive sleep apnea with hypoxia"".  My results sounds like I could die in my sleep; they are to that level of bad in terms of oxygen saturation being as low as 83% in non-REM.  It would seem that what I've experienced in the past is the result of hypoxia and severe sleep apnea.  The brain fog sounds like it could have been my brain losing oxygen for extended periods and impacting my cognition.  

Has anyone heard of anything like this before?  My only hope is that a CPAP can prevent this from happening again, and that it doesn't happen again in the meantime.  I no longer drink, I'm attempting to lose weight, I make sure not to get sleep deprived, I sleep on my side, etc.

## Study Result

### Impression

**Severe obstructive sleep apnea with hypoxia.**

### Narrative

**cc:**  


**DATE OF STUDY: 2/16**  
**COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC POLYSOMNOGRAM**  


**TECHNICAL: The patient underwent a comprehensive polysomnographic study with a sleep technologist in attendance. (EEG 6 channels F3, F4, C3, C4, O1, O2), (ECG, EOG, EMG) (chin and leg), airflow (oronasal thermal sensor and nasal air pressure transducer), respiratory effort (chest and abdominal) oxygen saturation, and body position were recorded. Scoring was performed according to AASM for scoring of sleep and associated events hypopnea was defined as reduction in airflow by greater or equal to 30% with greater or equal to 4% oxygen desaturation. Data acquisition, collation, and scoring have been validated and clinically correlated.**  


**Total time was 423 minutes with sleep efficiency of 92.6%. Sleep latency to stage II was 1 minute, which is consistent with severe somnolence. REM latency was prolonged and was 240 minutes.**  


**Sleep architecture showed 19% time spent in REM sleep, 13.4% in slow wave sleep, and 63.5% in stage II sleep.**  


**Frequent arousals with an arousal index of 20.6 per hour. There were frequent leg movements, but very few associated with arousals.**  


**The patient had 72 obstructive apneas seen in supine and mainly in non-supine position in non-REM phase. There were 24 mixed apneas and 212 obstructive hypopneas. 57 were seen in non-supine position in REM phase and 138 in non-supine position in non-REM phase. There were 17 episodes of obstructive hypopneas seen in supine position. Apnea-hypopnea index was worst in supine position but overall sleep test showed 43.7 per hour, which is consistent with severe obstructive sleep apnea with a complete drop in oxygen saturation as low as 83% in non-REM phase. Oxygen saturation and lowest during REM phase was 85%.**

SleepApnea,"I was diagnosed with severe apnea a few weeks ago (AHI is 78) and have since been denied a CPAP by my insurance. They said they had to wait a month before they could resubmit and try again. I’m getting more and more anxious by the night, freaking myself out by going to sleep now knowing how bad it is.

SleepApnea,"I was diagnosed with sleep apnea when I was eleven

I had my adenoids removed which didn’t help, but we never had a follow up study done and then moved so it was just never followed up on. Just sort of an accepted fact of my life. 

I have never slept well. The last time I felt rested was no joke October of 2014. I remember the exact night, I had stayed at a friends place when visiting my hometown and had no obligation to wake up at any time and a mattress well above my paygrade. I slept for 16 hours solid. 

I’m constantly cycling between feeling like my lack of quality sleep is literally driving me crazy and just being too tired to care. 

I saw a specialist a couple years ago after putting it off for years (moving around, life gets in the way etcetc). She basically blamed my sleep problems on a medication I take that a) is essential to take, b) I started taking long after being originally diagnosed and c) honestly helped if anything. The whole experience put me off pushing it further for a while. 

FINALLY I tried again. Saw a specialist. Scheduled an at home sleep study. They told me I do not have sleep apnea. 

I’m feeling very confused. I’m stuck between doubting the tests validity and doubting my own restlessness. And if it’s not sleep apnea, what the hell is it??? Not to mention the dozens of people who have told me they literally cannot detect my breathing while I sleep. I just don’t know what to even do from here. 

My pcp is brushing me off.

SleepApnea,"I was diagnosed with sleep apnea in the fall. AHI = 9. Never had any daytime sleepiness or headaches or anything, but my doctor suggested a sleep study given my size and because I snore. Sleep doc talked me into CPAP vs oral device. I've been using CPAP for about 3 months now. Use it (and struggle with it) every night. Started with a nasal mask, and switched to a full face mask shortly after. I breathe through my nose just fine when I'm awake, but tend to switch to mouth breathing when sleeping. I do get a bit of nasal congestion at bedtime for some reason

The CPAP seems to make my nasal congestion worse. I am constantly waking up in the night with a plugged nose and my mask filled with drool. I've altered the humidity and temperature settings to no avail. It's extremely frustrating.

Fast forward to this weekend. Went on a trip, decided to leave my CPAP home. Had the best sleep the two nights than I have had in a long time. Slept 8 hours through the night, woke up rested. No drool, no snoring.

Back home now, I'm very tempted to just take a break from the stupid thing. I'm sick of waking multiple times each night having to fiddle with my mask or wipe it out.

SleepApnea,"I'm not looking for encouragement, or some ""have faith"" type of answer. I'm looking for something tangible. 

Here's the deal: I wasn't always exhausted before I got the diagnosis and the machine. I was tired after particularly bad nights, sure, but in general I wasn't a zombie or anything like that. I would (very) occasionally wake up feeling very well rested, however. 

So I to some extent KNOW that a good night's sleep is possible, and I know what it feels like after it happens. And I know that's not happening for me with the CPAP- well, it kinda happened one night. One night out of ~45 so far. 

So since that's not happening, what other things would I look at to tell if it is working, or at least helping? Would I expect to start dropping some weight? Would I expect lower blood pressure? Would I expect to wake up fewer times during the night to pee? Would I expect to wake up hungry less often? Would I expect more motivation/ less depression despite not feeling particularly well-rested? 

Because if the answer is ""none of these"" then that really makes me wonder why I should bother.

Slept shallowly and most of the time awake so I guess that made my sleep study negative.

I have also been told that using cpap machine the night before can affect sleep study. I used cpap the night before my home sleep study(bought cpap myself withour prescription)

Also there were a lot of people saying they didnt get diagnosed with sleep apnea with home sleep study but they did the inlab sleep study.

May be using sleep aid like lunesta during home sleep study can help me to get diagnosed? Breathing difficulty keeps me awake almost all the time and make it hard for me to sleep and show sleep apnea.

SleepApnea,"Mods have been blocking this post, claiming that I'm trying to sell something, which is false. I'm just trying to help others who may have had a similar experience.

5'8"", 210, moderate OSA. However, what I have found so far is that our diagnoses can be subjective. My sleep problems vary night by night. Here's my improvement so far.

Did SnoreLab a few nights before I got my appliance to see how much I snore. This is pretty cool. You not only get the graphs/data, but you can hear subtleties of what goes on during sleep. I was a collapsed-throat type of snorer. Was nice to have a baseline to work with.

Started using the oral appliance type pictured in this link. My dentist took measurements and sent it off to be made

[https://www.smitsdental.com/img/services/dorsal2.jpg](https://www.smitsdental.com/img/services/dorsal2.jpg)

Snoring almost entirely eliminated. No other issues heard during the recording. First few nights were great. Slept better, felt better in the morning, more energy, fewer headaches. Wasn't hard to get the jaw used to it. A few nights into it, listening to my recording one night, I heard myself shifting some body part after every breath, possibly moving my feet. Restless leg syndrome runs in the family. This led me to learn about Periodic Limb Movement Disorder. Haven't heard any movement since. Several nights later, I heard myself engaging in periods of holding my breath for 10-30 seconds. I would make a few grunts during these episodes, then release my breath with a gasp. This is called catathrenia, which has several interesting influences that do play a role in my life. 1. A habit of strength training where holding the breath is more likely, instead of doing cardio where we use consistent breathing (true). 2. Stress (who isn't stressed in todays crazy world?) 3. Frequent computer use suggests that people unconsciously hold their breath when working under stress; gamers practice deep breathing to combat this during matches.

I continue to use SnoreLab every night and analyze my performance. I sleep even better when I reduce sugar/caffeine/alcohol, especially at least 4 hours before bedtime.

SleepApnea,"I’m at a loss of what to do and would greatly appreciate any help!! I have a pretty old BiPap machine, a system one 60 series Phillips Respironics. I’m sure most of you are aware of the recall and the absolute pain in the ass it has been. I was told I would be getting a replacement device a year and a half ago and have been told over and over “you’re on a wait list” every single time I call for an update. Over the past few weeks I have begun noticing an issue with my BiPap. Every time I moved the power cord it would turn the machine off. I have tried searching for new power cords and have ordered some off Amazon but they do not fit. Because my machine is so old, everything is discontinued. My machine has now twice turned off randomly in use, even though I did not move the cord. I have severe sleep apnea. When I had my sleep study done 8 years ago I had 117 apneas in 1 hour and my blood oxygen went down to 64, so it’s safe to say I cannot live without this machine. I cannot go to sleep because I will aspirate (it has happened before). I know I waited a long time to get a replacement device and that could be my fault, but if I wasn’t told over and over they would replace my device for free, I would have done what I needed to do and gotten a new device over a year ago and paid for it out of pocket. I don’t know what to do. I called my insurance company, my DME provider, Phillips, and the doctor on call at my doctors office. No one has been helpful. I plan on scheduling an appointment with my doctor first thing Monday but I don’t know how long it will take to get a device and there is no way in hell I can survive without one. Im honestly contemplating just going to the emergency room and seeing what they say. Has anybody experienced anything like this and have you been able to get an emergency authorization for a new device?!

SleepApnea,"I’ve been posting on Reddit for about 2 years now about my endless symptoms that have occurred 24/7. Recently I’m thinking maybe sleep apnea is to blame as they have not stopped for a minute since they came on. Here is the brief story: 

- I got my wisdom teeth removed. 3 days later all of these symptoms came on at once: Head pressure at the top back of my head, dry eye/vision feels like it’s off/blurry, sometimes feel my head throbbing/spasming, always feel tired, VERY hard to start my day, always feel disassociated or like I’m not fully present,  very hard to drive or go into crowded areas as I get very faint and can’t process crowds or a lot of movement. 

- I’ve went to all the major doctors and for a majority have seen 5+ of the same specialist. This includes neurologist, ent, eye doctor, headache specialist, allergist, multiple dentists, TMJ specialist, hospital numerous times, therapist, psychiatrist etc etc. 

- I have got all the major tests which show not a single problem: MRI, MRV, MRA, CT etc etc 

- doctors are currently just throwing me on anxiety medications and blaming this all on anxiety and depression. I did go through a very anxious event around the time this started which was a prolonged period experiencing covid on my own but prior to that never had a single issue with anxiety or depression. I never needed medicine for this or used medicine for anything. I was perfectly normal. 

I’ve been to over 50 doctors easily over the last 2 years. Nobody has a clue. Nobody has been able to make any progress. Nobody can guide me. Nobody can help. 

The last possible idea I can think of is sleep apnea. I know their is a connection with TMJ and sleep and my jaw did start clicking after I got my wisdom teeth out. I was told I have very mild TMJ and that multiple TMJ specialists and dentists would not link that directly to causing these symptoms. But could it be causing sleep apnea? I had one doctor mention possibly getting a sleep study as my airway appeared narrow or something like that. 

I literally always feel out of it, don’t feel at all refreshed in the morning, can’t process a lot of things happening at once, always feel pressure in my head, eyes are always fatigued and visually off. I just feel numb at this point. I’m only 28 and I can’t remember the last time I had a full day where I felt amazing, definitely not since this started.

But can sleep apnea be the answer? Could it be possible I’m just not sleeping right? I don’t snore and don’t think that I wake up at all throughout the night.

This post is meant to open a legitimate discussion for those of us who are CPAP intolerant.

What I do not value or respect are dismissive, snarky and rude comments from some in this community regarding CPAP intolerance, which I’ve seen frequently. 

I believe that a large percentage of us who cannot tolerate CPAP may not be not neurotypical. Our intolerance is valid and our quest for treatment matters.

My sleep specialist and my PCP have both failed to provide any additional medical guidance for my untreated UARS.

They are quick to send referrals for Inspire, MMA surgery, dental devices or rx sleep aids. None of those are options I’d like to pursue. 

Prescription medication, vitamin, food and environmental allergies/intolerance/reactions are all real, so why is it difficult for CPAP intolerance to be given the same grace and validation?

SleepApnea,"Hi all

I did an at home sleep study for 3 nights and all of them I spent in anxiety because I worried about the results. I would wake up every 10-15 minutes without a stop and in essence, I barely slept those 3 nights. Still, during the day I didn't feel worse as I usually do so that's an indication by itself. Almost as if my sleep is more damaging than staying sort of awake during the night.

I believe practically staying half-awake throughout severely impacted my test results. Here they are:

[https://pdfhost.io/v/TRkmhXbIb\_1673\_09021102\_Parinideen](https://pdfhost.io/v/TRkmhXbIb_1673_09021102_Parinideen)

As I progressed from night 1 to night 3, the data seems to get worse. This is in line with me getting slightly less nervous over the course. But even the 3rd night, I basically didn't sleep.

Still, it seems as though I do have an issue with SP02. I fall below 95 for most of the night and I get around 10 desaturations per hour on the 3rd night. I'm certain the numbers would be way worse if I had actually slept.

What do I do with this information? Obviously the ""AHI"" is really low, but the SP02 is worrying and my symptoms seem to match  Sleep-Related Hypoxemia a lot.

I struggle to get up in the mornings, I wake up with headaches, heart pain, dizziness, fatigue.. I barely function and I hate living like this from day to day.

SleepApnea,"Hi All,

Recently seen a sleep doctor and I'm suspected to have sleep apnea (soon to book in for sleep study). Pretty shocked to be honest as I am only 25 years old and reasonably fit. It all started when my sleep became severely impacted last year and I developed TMJD, which apparently is associated with sleep apnea. 

I did a bit of digging on the net, and I saw these neat little rings from wellue that measure your SP02, heart rate and movement at night, which apparently is an indicator of whether someone has sleep apnea. 

I've uploaded an image of last nights sleep, was wondering if someone can help me interpret the data. My lowest saturation score (which i achieved during a 2 hr nap in the afternoon) was 86% (not pictured in the link).

SleepApnea,"I'm just joking around because it's a Friday night, and I have a long weekend because my office is closed on Monday for Presidents' Day in the USA.

Anyway, a few years ago, my husband took me to stay in a bed and breakfast with a restaurant that has been a tavern with lodging since the 1700's. George Washington reportedly drank and slept here, and even if he didn't, several outlaws were executed in front of this place because for a while it also served at the community's courthouse. Anyway, we spent the night in one of the rooms that was reputed to be haunted.

According to the local lore, some visitors staying in this room reported waking up in the middle of the night to feel someone holding them down in the bed.

""I hope that I get to meet one of the ghosts,"" I said to my husband that night before we went to sleep.

Well, in the middle of the night, I woke up to feel someone holding me down in the bed. It wasn't my husband. He was sound asleep on the other side of the bed.

I fell asleep again. I woke up while it was still dark to hear the sound system in the restaurant portion of this building just blaring 60's rock music. I got up and looked outside the window. The only cars in the parking lot were ours and those of the other B&amp;B guests. The staff hadn't yet arrived to open the restaurant for the morning.

I fell back asleep again.

The next morning, the hostess said to us, ""Did you guys encounter any of the ghosts?"" She smiled at me.

""Maybe,"" I said. I smiled back. Did she already know that the sound system went off in the dining area in the middle of the night?

So, I legitimately thought that one of the ghosts held me down in bed that night. I was torn about the reason why the restaurant's sound system went off in the middle of the night. Maybe the automatic timer on it malfunctioned?

About a year and a half after this, I was diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea, and I started using a CPAP. Now that I am treating my Sleep Apnea, I wonder if my ""encounter"" with the ghost in the bed in the haunted B&amp;B room was just a symptom of my Sleep Apnea.

SleepApnea,"Hi there. I’m 25M, I’m an average weight and have been on CPAP for six months. I’ve tried six different masks, had multiple studies and I’ve slept a total of about 5 or 6 hours with the machine out of around 450 usage hours. I’ve had a tonsillectomy as well. I have asked a lot of questions here, so forgive me. I really appreciate all of the help that the thoughtful, friendly and informed users of this forum have provided for me. 

My current question is, has anyone with apnea had their tongue tie corrected as an adult, and did it improve their AHI or symptoms? I have had a tongue tie my whole life and can’t stick my tongue out more than an inch past my bottom lip. 

The medical literature I’ve read and my sleep doctor both have expressed that sleep apnea tends to occur below the tongue, but I am confused about this for a few reasons: 
- Infants and children have their tongue ties corrected, not only due to speech problems and issues latching during breastfeeding, but also on account of correcting pediatric sleep apnea. How is it possible that there is zero relationship between adult sleep apnea and tongue tie? 
-The Inspire implant, from my understanding, stimulates the hypoglossal nerve, which involves the muscles of the tongue and the airway. If this implant is successful at treating apnea, wouldn’t there likely be some benefit of increasing the freedom of the tongue? 
-From what I’ve read, the tongue is *supposed* to touch the roof of your mouth when sleeping. I can’t even hold this position without pain while conscious. If my tongue isn’t where it should be, couldn’t this affect my airway? 
-My breathing improves and I feel as though it is significantly easier to inhale, and more fulfilling, when I stick my tongue out. This is just subjective, but I thought it was worth mentioning. 

Anyway, I was curious to ask about the experiences of others, on the chance some people have found success despite the general medical advice. In all honesty, I am thinking of undergoing the procedure anyway, so this would also be a tangential benefit.

SleepApnea,"I finally got a prescription for an APAP (honestly I probably need bipap, but the titration study data was ""insufficient"" to be able to prescribe bipap... Probably because I slept for about 4 hours and only had 5 minutes of REM sleep... It was a rough night).

I worked in ICU with the super intense hospital bipap machines... But I don't know anything about having one at home. And I work in oncology now, so my knowledge about CPAP/bipap is way out of date.

SleepApnea,"Hi all. I’ve always had trouble sleeping to some extent due to poor habits and an overactive mind, but recently I’ve begun to experience brain fog. My head feels fuzzy and thinking generally is a little tougher, also reading is noticeably more strenuous (I often have to re read to understand a sentence) 

My question is, are these symptoms in line with a potential sleep disorder like sleep apnea? The only thing that makes me doubt it a little is that I’ve always had these habits so why only now would they affect me, and I don’t generally feel too tired through the day (certainly some amount but not to the extent I would expect from the cognitive impairment im experiencing). 

Another thing, I have created health habits around going to sleep and can do so albeit with some effort, but I do wake up 3-5 times a night with varying degrees of alertness each time. 

It’s a lot to read, but I would really appreciate anyones input or experience. I’m just feeling a little concerned.

I have one of those blood pressure monitors and it shows me my heart rate and it’s around 116/118 sometimes anyways so it’s only the first hours of when I wake up is this due to sleep apnea?

SleepApnea,"I'm pretty sure I am going to be needing a CPAP machine since I check many of the boxes in terms of symptoms and physical condition.  I just completed a Lofta / WatchPAT study overnight and transmitted the results this morning.  I expect it will be next week before they do their analysis and get back with me for a consult. 

I've been researching machines and it looks like in general ResMed is the way to go.  I'm not going through insurance since I have a HDHP and will not come anywhere close to my deductible so I don't see a point in jumping through Blue Cross hoops (and wait months) to probably spend more.  

I've been signing up for email deals from the major online vendors, but it seem they all exclude new machines and ResMed in general.  I was surprised to just get an email from [cpap.com](https://cpap.com) with their Valentines discount code (LOVESLEEP) that gives good looking prices. but the sale expires Sunday:

Airsense 11 Autoset - $899 (was $989)

Airsense 10 Autoset Card to Cloud - $499 (was $913)

Are CPAP vendors like mattress and furniture stores where I'll get a Presidents Day sale code next week, LUCKYSLEEP code for St. Patrick's day, etc?

SleepApnea,"Hello everyone and thank you for your time and attention. 

I'm having a really bad time with this whole CPAP/BiPAP experience and it really has me stressed out. I did a sleep test about a year ago, with terrible sleepless nights for weeks after, and I just had my device fitting today, wore it for a couple minutes as the technician set the straps (full face mask), and now I'm having what I feel like are breathing problems all over again - like after my sleep test. 

It's a number of things that combine to make this an overall horrible experience for me, here are two big ones: 

1. I have such a hard time adapting to the pressure - I feel this sensation of drowning, when I first try to put it on and it freaks me out. It's like I'm waterboarding myself with air;  
2. After wearing the device, like even for a couple minutes while getting fitted today, my lungs feel wrecked. My breathing feels ragged and weak. I can't stop yawning. I've been burping a lot. I feel like I can't get air. I feel like I'm on the verge of an asthma attack and like there's something in my lungs that I just can't cough out. I really want to emphasize that post-device-wearing, I feel physically beat up. I don't think this is supposed to happen. 

And now, I can't sleep. I dread putting this device on. I still feel physically and mentally drained and sick from my fitting today. I didn't have a problem falling asleep before this, but I can't now. I also noticed, while walking around today that I 'snored' while just regularly breathing. This is not typical.    

I'm just so freaked out about the experience. I tried lying there in bed and now I'll feel like I can't breath. And then I start panicking.   


**Some Relevant Background:**

I was prescribed a BiPAP (E0470) for my obstructive sleep apnea (full face mask). Pressure setting is 25. I'm 40 yrs old, male, 6'2"" 230 lbs a little overweight. Have asthma and a deviated septum. Mouth breather. Been physically active most of my life, including a lot of sports into college, until having children in my early 30s, going back to school, and then dealing with sports injuries and a somewhat stressful 9-5 made me a bit sedentary. Caught COVID in April 2022, I was double-vaxxed before, and I feel like I have had long-COVID since then, and my breathing has been pretty fragile. I hadn't had an asthma attack since I was a kid, but I was starting to find that my childhood asthma seemed to have returned. Post-COVID, I have had pre-hypertension, pre-diabetes, been going in for all kinds of tests to figure out why I feel a general sick feeling most days.     

After my quarantine, I did my overnight sleep test and it was a horrible experience for me. I recall just having the feeling of ragged breathing, shortness of breath, sleepless nights, for weeks after. My apnea was worse than it had been before. It felt like it took weeks for my breathing to get back to feeling like how it was pre-sleep test.  

In fact, the worst of my current health conditions (listed above), really started to surface in the weeks after this sleep test. It's like COVID did a number on me, but the sleep test just exacerbated it all.  


**My Current Problems:**

Yesterday morning, I went in to get my BiPAP fitted and the technician had me demo it. I had the hardest time getting used to the pressure. The technician had to ramp significantly ramp down the pressure just to get me to be able to endure it. Again, it feel like I was drowning on air - I know it's a silly concept, but that's how it feels for me. And I only wore it for like 2 minutes. 

Probably the worst part of this experience is post-device-wearing sickness - or what I feel like it is. When the device came off, I feel like I'm down one lung. I feel like it's so much harder to breath, like the atmosphere is suddenly so heavy. The feeling was such a shock that I immediately asked the technician if it's possible for your brain/body to form a dependency on the device. It felt like my lungs were starved of oxygen. 

In addition, my lungs felt wrecked, beat up. My breathing felt ragged, like my inhale was weak and I couldn't take in air. I immediately kept yawning and it would go on like that for hours. I felt lethargic, drained, really weak, and sick. About a half-hour to an hour later, I kept having to burp. I have this feeling like I have a fist in my chest, upper ab, right below the sternum... like I have to give a big belch, but I just can't. I mentioned earlier that I noticed I would occasionally ""snore"" during non-sleep breathing - this is not typical for me. I also notice that when I yawn, I feel like the air is even more restricted going in. I feel like this is device-related. I remember feeling horrible like this after my sleep test and it took weeks to recover to pre-sleep test status. 

It's been about 20 hours or so since I did my BiPAP fitting and I still feel these horrible feelings. I tried going to sleep and I can't.  When I lay down, I feel like I have a weight on my chest and my lungs are having to work harder to inhale. As I sit at my computer typing this, I notice that I have to try to inhale deep because it feels like I'm not getting air. On top of all the physical problems I get left with, I have now developed some mental health issues.

I have a dread for wearing the device - I don't want to feel sick. Just the breathing issues alone and this sick struggling feeling that I've been feeling all day, post-device-wearing, it has scared me into not wanting to wear it. It only took 2 minutes of wearing the device to make me feel this terrible. 

And I really don't think claustrophobia is playing a part in this. I'm fine with wearing masks. The biggest problems is dealing with the drowning on air feeling and then this horribly persistent sick, wrecked, ragged, feeling that I get after wearing the device. 

Has anyone out there had a similar experience? Could my adverse experience have been connected to COVID?

SleepApnea,my girlfriend and i have been together for a little over a month now and this past week we’ve been sleeping at each others houses for the first time. we are both in early 20’s. but i’ve noticed that she has given off several signs of sleep apnea and sleeping together has solidified my thoughts i think. she would frequently take a breathe and then would stop breathing for a few seconds (5-10 secs) to the point where i could tell her body was trying to take another breathe but couldn’t. she would kind of twitch a bit and then her airway would open up and she would snore a bit and usually readjust her body. i guess i’m more curious on how i should bring this up to her without offending her? she isn’t overweight in any way but has had a past that she shared of being bulimic and is still very self conscious about her weight. so i feel like if i tell her she will think it’s cause she is overweight or something and i don’t want her to fall apart and go back to the way she was since being overweight is the most common cause of sleep apnea.,t2_er6dg7gg,0,I think my girlfriend has sleep apnea,[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,114qq66,True,No-Animator-3184,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/114qq66/i_think_my_girlfriend_has_sleep_apnea/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/114qq66/i_think_my_girlfriend_has_sleep_apnea/,35384,1676651001,0,,False,1676651012,1676651013,2023-02-17 16:23:21,,,,,,,

SleepApnea,"So basically I have been on resmed CPAP for 4 years. I get my supplies through insurance who goes through lincare. Out of the blue lincare is calling me and asking me to drive to their facility with my SD card to verify compliancy before sending me more supplies.

I told the person they can pull my data via cell connection and they said they couldn't. They expect me to waste my time and drive an hour to their facility for something that can be done via email or access to the device via cell tower?

SleepApnea,"So last night was my first night on the resmed 10 and my first night overall on a CPAP machine.  Set up was a breeze, I do need to buy an SD card though for the OSCAR.  

My experience was positive.  I feel asleep pretty quickly and woke up a few times and played with the mask because I felt like it wasn’t on right.  The pressure wasn’t too noticeable.  

I haven’t noticed any energy level difference, but it is the first night and I have the new few days off.  The real test will be once I’m back at work and in my “normal” routine.  

I’ll attack my results from resmed below:

SleepApnea,"I had my at-home sleep study done last night,  and couldn't sleep almost at all. I'm a bit stressed that If the device got enough data to be accurate.

Some background:

I've had on/off insomnia for over two years, and now even if I've had a ""better period"" of sleeping, I've noticed I'm still tired and fatiqued. Brain fog being by far the worst symptom. Also I noticed that I don't recover from the gym like I used to. I initially contacted my workplace healthcare to check my thyroid and ferritin values, but as they were all good, the doc suggested that I might got sleep apnea and they booked the study right away.

Sleep apnea does check some boxes, but I think I'm quite far from ""typical"" apnea patient.
I exercise regularly and according to my girlfriend I don't snore almost at all.

SleepApnea,"Been on CPAP for 10+ years, initially diagnosed with mild OSA.  Events always under 5/hr.

Past year or so, I've been having more central apneas out of nowhere. Nothing changed - same nasal pillows mask, meds, bed routine, etc. I talked to my sleep doc and we decided to go ahead and switch to Bilevel PAP since my insurance would cover it without a new titration study. I was started on auto mode, min EPAP 4 max IPAP 15, PS 4. My AHI was under 5/hr some nights but other nights would shoot up to 15-20/hr, mostly central events. My sleep doc couldn't figure out why but increased my EPAP and PS slightly. Same thing. So we did a titration study and of course it was a good night so my AHI was under 5/hr and the interpreting physician recommended I continue on my current auto settings. The tech started me on 12/8 and basically didn't change anything the whole night.

SleepApnea,"Little backstory. I’ve been diagnosed with OSA since I was 14, I’m now 25. Had an AHI of 48 when first diagnosed at Stanford Sleep Medicine, which doctors were blown away by because I was so young and really skinny.

Was on CPAP for about 5 years up until age 19. CPAP did not help one bit, despite wearing for 5 years. I was never tolerant of CPAP and it never worked for me. I could sleep a whole night with it on, but no matter what, still felt the same as if I didn’t wear it.

At age 16 I had tonsils, adenoids, and uvula removed. Brought my AHI from 48 to 20.

Still exhausted all the time and intolerant to CPAP, zero difference in the way I felt. 

At 19, my doctor said my last resort was MMA surgery. Apparently, I was one of the first 20 people to have this done, and it was still somewhat experimental. It was being done by one of the best in the world at Stanford, so I had high hopes, and so did my surgeon.

Got the surgery, and the recover was fucking insane. I grew up doing lots of extreme sports, lots of injuries and surgeries from broken bones. And NOTHING compares to the recovery of my MMA surgery. Anyways, took a few months to recover, and I’ll never forget the first day I woke up from my first ever good nights rest without CPAP. I felt high, indestructible, like I could conquer the world. I had officially been cured. I didn’t realize that this is what normal felt like. I don’t know HOW I managed to go through daily life the last 10 years

Anyways, fast forward a few years, and I notice symptoms start to come back. I never took another sleep study, because to be honest my symptoms weren’t too bad. And I was partying a lot in college (like too much) so I attributed it to that. Couple more years go by, graduated from college, and have had a job for a few years, live a normal life, but my symptoms are so much worse. I feel like I did when I had an AHI of 48, before my surgery.

I go to UCLA to get a sleep study, shit is taking months to get sorted. Finally get the sleep study, and I have an AHI of 24. I felt like giving up. All the surgeries, years of CPAP, thousands of dollars. And I STILL have sleep apnea, and I’m only 25 and still really skinny. My sleep doctor knows all about my intolerance to CPAP and my past surgeries, and recommends an oral appliance, or MAD device, even though I’ve already had MMA surgery and tonsil surgery blah blah blah. He was confident a MAD would work.

Anyways, finally got my MAD device 2 days ago. I was pretty tolerant of it. Slept like 5 hours the first cuz I kept waking up for weird reason, but I still felt for refreshed and rested than I had in the last 5 years. I felt that high again of being rested. However, my second night I slept even more hours, around 7. And today I feel like fucking shit. Back to square 1, no difference at all.

My question is: does it take a bit to get adjust to an MAD? Is it normal to have ups and downs like this in the beginning? Or was it all just a placebo on my first night. I know with CPAP it’s common for it to take months to feel results. Idk, running out of hope and I feel like giving up and it’s making me depressed that I’m just gonna have to feel like shit and suffer for the rest of my life.

If this doesn’t work, has anyone had luck with Inspire implants, or other procedures?

SleepApnea,"Hey yall! I just finished my first night of the BioSerenity at-home sleep test. 

For the past two years, I've had worsening symptoms that now include intense daytime sleepiness, bad brain fog, GERD, memory problems, etc. I can sleep 10-12 hours and still feel like a zombie. If I don't use two pillows, I wake up from a choking sensation. All of this, and I never thought I fit the risk factors (young, not really overweight), but my NP noted that alcohol and tobacco severely worsen risk factors.

With that being said, I called BioSerenity to check on the quality of my data (got over 7 hours last night), and they said to call back tomorrow after my second night of data has been transmitted so they know can bump me up and get my results back ASAP.

So I'm curious -- for anyone who has taken a BioSerenity at-home test (or any other at-home test), are they usually pretty accurate? Do you think it means anything if they were adamant about speeding up my diagnosis process? TIA!!

SleepApnea,"There are 4 events in the following audio fragment with a few seconds of pauze between:

https://vocaroo.com/1dtIbgC14M50

I've been recording my sleep for around 20 days and this pattern happens basically every 5-10 minutes, for mostly the entire night every night.

1. I breath normally till I start breathing more heavily through my nose.
2. After roughly 10-15 seconds I gasp through my mouth.
3. I (sometimes turn over and) start scratching(I have eczema) for around 30 seconds.
4. I continue sleeping breath normally through my nose.

Audio waveform of that particular night:
https://imgur.com/a/8MH4p2E

The peaks in the the graph mean that I touched the microphone during tossing/scratching, so the smaller amplitudes in the waveform are the same occurrences as the big ones.

I'm tired from the morning throughout the entire day and have issues concentrating for longer than half an hour. I used to snore extremely loudly and have had an nose septum adjustment(the adjustment didn't help with my sleep). I started using a sticker on my mouth for about a year to stop myself from snoring around 2 years ago, this stopped my snoring for the most part but I feel like this might have caused this underlying issue to pop up.

I've done a sleep test recently at home and the doctor(throat, nose and ear) concluded I don't have sleep apnea(2,5 something) and I should go back to the GP. Afterwards I sent him this exact audio clip and was told I'l by the assistant i'l receive a call in exactly a month.

SleepApnea,"Where I live there's a big issue with the sleep study waitlist being 1 to 2 years, well thats on the public insurance and you can pay 200 for a private one that takes a few weeks. I just think (could be mistaken) that if you go that way you can't get a CPAP partially paid for youd have to pay the whole thing yourself unlike if you do go with the public option which I think covers over 50%. 

Luckily my doctors were able to get me on a cancelation list and I got moved up, finally getting tested next week. I'm also getting a tonsillectomy next month because they have gotten quite enlarged and bothering me all the time, I spoke to a specialist who said they can cause sleep disruptions when they get like that. So that is what I've been suspecting since I've had fatigue since the summer getting a few tonsil infections in a row and they stayed enlarged after. 

I guess I'll be confused if it turns out I don't have apnea on which case the fatigue was probably from lingering covid issues and mental health such as high stress. But damn it has lasted a long time at this point and I never feel rested. Well actually recently has been the only time I've felt better, lost about 10lbs and been exercising a lot among quite a few other good habits I've been building. But still never have the energy I used to have. So of that happens to be the case at least I'll know. 

If I do have it, well I'm getting my tonsils out soon and idk if I'd need a CPAP after that because thats when the whole thing started.

SleepApnea,"I got my cpap a few weeks ago and this is the mask it came with. It came with a card to measure my nose to choose the appropriate sized mask.

The card indicates that a small sized mask would fit best. However the small and even the medium seem too small for me. They constrict my nostrils and make breathing difficult, so I have been using the large sized cushion. 

The large is comfortable, however I frequently wake up to large leaks. I am a side sleeper and I think this may loosen it and break the seal.

Last night I tried to sleep with the medium size and I just couldn’t do it. I kept waking up not being able to breath because it pushes my nostrils in and closes the airway.

SleepApnea,"I was diagnosed with mild OSA in April 2021, about 6 years after symptoms of sleep apnea started. I was young and healthy but my sleep really deteriorated quickly and I started to feel not so healthy.

Fast forward to 2019 I had my wisdom teeth removed and for an entire month after I had no sleep issues and I felt amazing. I was literally jumping out of bed with joy every morning. 

This only lasted a month or so and then my sleep apnea kicked in. 

So I’ve been trodding along with seriously debilitating health issues caused by poor sleep and allegedly poor oxygenation during sleep for several years now and we find ourselves in spring of 2022.

I took a breathwork course with a man who set the US breathhold record, over 7 minutes. I’m learning how to not only hold my breath but to generate a feeling of calm and contentment during intense neurophysiological stress. In four weeks my breathhold triples from a depressing :30 seconds to a decent 1:30. Not only did the time improve but the quality of the time improved. 1:30 became easy and effortless. 

During this time my sleep improved dramatically and I resolved all of my health issues. For four months I was living like a king. Happy, energetic, well rested, I even had a freaking appetite! I thought I had fixed my sleep issues for good and this was it, I was back to living a normal, happy, healthy life. Not waking up every morning feeling like I’d had 30 beers the night before. 

Signs, not just symptoms, of sleep apnea went away too- teeth indentions on my tongue, teeth grinding and jaw tension all went away. 

One of the exercises that I did during this breathwork was to hold my breath and allow my diaphragm to relax, allowing the air to go back up to my nose. But instead of letting it escape you tension your soft palette. 

My thought is that this could have improved the integrity of my mouth and reduced the obstruction in OSA. 

Another thought I had is that practicing apnea improved my experience or sleep apnea, improving oxygenation and cellular respiration. 

Last I think there’s something about being able to handle intense stress and generate a feeling of peace within yourself that heals the brain and body, specific the limbic system. I know that my stress tolerance and ability to regulate my emotions has diminished since developing sleep apnea and this experience through breathwork I believe has a positive effect on the limbic brain which regulates our emotions, stress response,  and how we generate stories about ourselves and the world. 

But all of these positive effects did only last for about four months and went away. I did stop doing the breathwork but when I came back to it it didn’t have the same impact.

SleepApnea,"This may be premature as I’m still waiting on the results from my sleep study and an official diagnosis of sleep apnea, but I have concerns about potentially being prescribed a CPAP machine.

I am now out of that situation and have my own home which feels very safe away from him and “untouched” by home as it were. I’m not biologically related to him, so I wasn’t expecting the sleep apnea, but I show a lot of the signs. I really don’t want to have to use a CPAP machine.

So I had decided to do a lab sleep study in order to rule out if sleep apnea is my cause of daytime fatigue, brain fog, dry mouth and all other problems.

Everything went well with the sleep study, fallen asleep around 11:30, but woke up at like 4:50 thirsty as hell and observed that the oximeter frorm my finger has dropped out during my sleep. Having noticed this I just put it back again and went to sleep again until around 9-9:15 waking up with it’s still in my finger.

SleepApnea,"30 years old and I really need to get my sleep apnea under control - I’m a bit stressed about this due to heart issues. I beyond failed with a CPAP machine a few years ago. Got a BIPAP machine yesterday, only used it for 2.9 hours last night and am struggling tonight. The BIPAP is FAR better than the CPAP but I still can’t work it. It’s a Nasal cover which generally sounds better than full mouth cover. I notice that I need to even out the pressure in my head pretty often (like a slight yawn, like popping your ears in a plane) but I can’t do this with the machine blasting air or even just covering my nose. Just swallowing my spit/closing my mouth causes that pressurized feeling in my head and that’s majorly messing with my ability to relax. 


And I don’t know what setting I could use to make the machine feel better. There’s tons of settings but the instruction manual doesn’t seem to go over the difference and the doctors who gave the machine to me just handed it off without much instruction.

Setting I see include
IPR Off/0/1/2/3
Preheat: Off/On
P Ramp: 3/3.5/4
Ramp Time: 0-60 Minutes
Humidity Level: 1-8

SleepApnea,"I have had bad sleep at least since my teenage years. Every night I have had to use the bathroom at least twice and I never felt like I slept enought. Recently this has been getting worse and I found myself not being able to focus at work and barely funtioning in my everyday life.

A few weeks ago I went to a pulmonologist and had an at home sleep study done which came back at 10 events per hour. Felt very relieved because I thought I finally had an answer to all my sleep troubles but still had to wait for an in lab sleep study which I had done the other day. This came back at 0.8 events per hour. This feels like an absolute blow because I thought I finally had answer and now I don't. Everybody I talked to told me that those tests don't produce false positives so now I am kinda lost.

The doc said I could come back in 2 months for another sleep study at the earliest. When I had the at home study done I was still going to work everyday and dragging myself to work out. Since then I have been on sick leave because it was just unbearable. Could the dicrepancy between the 2 tests maybe be stress related?

My question now is where to go from here. Does anybody have any suggestions on what to do now or what else could cause this? Or could it still be sleep apnea?

SleepApnea,"hey all - curious if folks here may have any insight for me.

when I first started using my cpap I was advised to wear a face mask that covered my mouth, which I tried for several months. However, I often found it to be uncomfortable in the positions I like to sleep in, and would sometimes take it off in the middle of the night unconsciously, so I would wake up to find I hadn't had it on, which of course defeats the purpose.

Recently I tried switching to a nose only mask, and found it to be much more comfortable. However, what I can't figure out is if it is equally effective. When I switched to the nose mask my obstruction numbers got a lot lower, which could be great - this masks works better! Or I think could be worse - it is't catching a lot of them, if I mouth breathe? However,  I don't \*think\* I breathe through my mouth at night, but I am single and have been for a while, so I don't really know. I tried taping my mouth for a while to test if that was any different then not taping, and it wasn't. 

Just the past few nights I tried switching back to the full face mask again, and found that my obstructions did go up again, though not to the peak they once were. 

Ideally, I'd ask my doctor, but I don't have an appointment coming up, and have to pay a co-pay so trying to do some trouble shooting on my own and see if I can save the questions to our next scheduled appointment.

- Setting up expectations. It will take 3-4 weeks to adjust. Advised them to wear it during the day as well.
- Offering different masks. 
- Lowering/increasing the pressure. Have EPR on to 3.
- Reiterating importance of CPAP to protect their health and improve sleep/daytime function - ""If I die so be it, I've lived x amount of years without it""
- For people on sleep aids prior to CPAP, I've also had them slightly increase their dose while adjusting to CPAP

SleepApnea,"Met with the ENT today to review results of post-surgical sleep study, which I did with an at-home study on February 28 (surgery was October 5). My original AHI was 76, and the new study came back with AHI 46. Still severe sleep apnea, but pretty much exactly the expected result. He will be submitting an authorization request to my insurance for the Inspire device surgery. Hoping to get to AHI 15 or below following that procedure, which is expected to have a much, much easier recovery period than the last surgery. With travel and other plans coming up, I may end up not scheduling it until May or June.

SleepApnea,"Greetings. 
My AHI is 19.0
I am looking to buy my first CPAP.



From where I live these are the prices. I’ll just convert them to dollars for reference.

1)
Resmed 10 AutoSet: $1,450 with a choice of (1)
N20 Classic, Airfit N20, N30i or Nasal Pillow p10 mask.

OR

2)
Resmed 11 AutoSet: $1,550 with Airtouch F20 mask.


From what I gathered here, I found comments that Resmed 11 water chamber seems to be a problem to some people that the quantity of water is not the same as the 10’s.

On the other hand, some people’s resmed 11 are fine with the water chamber and no reports of burnt smell.

I noticed that Resmed 10 is at at the end of the product line, while the 11’s is quite new. The only thing that reasons that is making  me to choose the Resmed 10 is that it is already a trusted and established product line for the last 7 years. (?)

The seller advised me to take the Resmed 11 because since it’s new, it would be easier to get parts/repair in the next few years. So that made also think about getting Resmed 11.


What are other the pros and cons of resmed 11? Vice versa.
What would you get?


This will be my first CPAP.

SleepApnea,"I'm a 24 years old with a healthy BMI (below 25) and I've been having symptoms of OSA for the last 2 years starting from the spring of 2021. The symptoms have gotten progressively worse over the course of my disease as it was undiagnosed and untreated.

I know that this is all due to sleep apnea because all of my symptoms get worse the more tired I am; and all of them can be tied down to the fact that I am sleepy/tired (the progression of my symptoms have literally been coextensive with the increasing level of fatigue that I experienced over the course of the last 2 years). I was diagnosed with an RDI of 17.8 and an AHI of 1.1 but I was told by my ENT doctor who specialises in sleep apnea that this was probably because the device that I used for the home sleep test did not measure airflow and chest movement; to the effect that hypoapneas might not have been detected by the device. I am due to have another home sleep study with a better equipment to confirm the diagnosis.

I suspected that I have sleep apnea because of the symptoms I've read on the internet. I also came from r/Orthotropics and r/Mewing.

1. I always feel exhausted after I wake up and my eyes always feel tired like it was open during my sleep. 
2. I always oversleep. 12 hours and sometimes even more. Though I wake up in the middle of my sleep like 3 hours in and just suddenly sleep again. (sometimes I wake up multiple times) I also notice that my dreams are becoming more vivid (not sure if it's a lucid dream because sometimes I can control and sometimes I can't, it's also not a POV dream) and it feels like I'm awake at that time and I think it causes my overlseepiness and my tired eyes. 
3. I've always been a mouth breather but I've managed to be consistent on nose breathing around 2 years ago and it helped with my drooling so I guess I'm doing good (came from r/mewing and it kinda helps) 
4. I do snore apparently and I also find myself waking up from my snore or more like I'm about to snore and it wakes me up. 

I went to an ENT doctor before because of my nose. I always have a runny nose only on 1 nostril even if i'm not sick and it always has mucus and smelt bad. It was found that I have a tight airway on my 1 nostril because there is a pus (not sure about the term). The doctor prescribed me a nasal spray and it kinda helped me a little bit. I've yet to experience the mucus thing for now but I still breathe a lot more air on my other nostril.

I also have to mention that my room has poor ventilation and I also have a rockwool in my room (not on the inside of the wall but literally have it on frame because I use it for sound insulation for music producing)

Sorry for my bad english

SleepApnea,"Hello, 

I recently had a sleep test completed due to consistent fatigue, brain fog and symptoms of depression. During my follow up consultation with a specialist it was noted that my oxygen dipped well into the 80s overnight and my ""arousals"" were severely elevated. However, the specialist referred to my sleep test as normal but did say I should look into psychological issues. Are any of these numbers concerning? I might look for a second opinion or have another test. I wake up 5-6 times per night but fall back asleep quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Total arousal index ""severely increased"" at 33.5 events per hour.  
* Stage N3 sleep was reduced at 6.2% of sleep period. 
* 26 total hypopneas. 
* Sp02 data showed oxygen desaturations to 85%
* 23.1% of total sleep time spent below 90%

SleepApnea,"I was recently told I make these CRAZY very jarring snoring sounds while I sleep, so naturally I downloaded an app that recorded my sleep last night.

It’s a kind of squeaking for air, slight rattle type snore sound, like air passing through a balloon? But not so high pitched. 
Well naturally I am like, is this sleep apnea? I’m not so sure it is because I don’t notice the stopping breathing moments in the recording. 

Wondering if anyone has insight- I can post the recording for you to hear if interested. Though next thing- I’m not entirely sure this is the appropriate sub Reddit for this? Having a hard time finding one that can help me. Open to redirecting!

SleepApnea,"Hi there. I’ve been attempting to use CPAP and mostly failing for about 400 hours, with around 5 hours of sleep actual sleep. To be honest, the CPAP is a torture device for me, but I’m desperate because my apnea results in panic attacks that make me feel like I am dying for a half hour at a time because of carbon dioxide buildup, on top of all the other awful symptoms. 

I’ve literally gone through over 7 masks at this point and the only one that I can even *try* to sleep in is the Dreamwear Nasal. However, it MUST be incredibly tight or else it leaks extremely loudly and even if I wear industrial-grade ear plugs, the sound still penetrates and actually is amplified. Basically, everything I try with CPAP fails and it’s kind of just been a horrible half year long string of failure after failure. 

Anyway…Despite all this trouble, I keep trying with the Dreamwear, night after night, usually attempting about 2 to 4 hours and eventually giving up because I can’t stop working for the sake of this thing. Throughout this usage, even though it’s less than most, I have noticed a really troubling change in my facial features. My nose appears to be permanently swollen and also appears to have become far more asymmetrical than it used to be. I have examples of how my nose used to look and how it looks now. I am worried this has negatively changed my appearance and that it will continue to get worse, with no way of correcting it. Has anyone else experienced this? 

I have read some other CPAP forums on this issue, but honestly, they seem like the same cabal of posters who relentlessly mock anyone who brings this up (or anyone who has any difficulty with CPAP whatsoever, for that matter) despite there being an actual medical study that suggests changes to the face from CPAP. Some of them seem like they might be paid to act as dismissively as they do.

SleepApnea,"I've been messing with my RESMED machine for an hour or so, I found a setting called ""Therapy Mode"" and changed it from AutoSet to CPAP.

The issue here is not so much that the machine adjusts automatically, but that it only seems to adjust one way. When I get into bed and put my mask on, I am breathing a lot more shallow than I do when I'm asleep. I'm scrolling through my phone or just thinking and I take small short breathes. Then when I fall asleep I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I'm suffocating because the machine is trying to predict my breathing patterns using the short breaths.

SleepApnea,"Weird question…or perhaps just a weird observation…

If I put on my mask and fall asleep using my CPAP machine, my AHI is most often within expected/acceptable range.

However, if I fall asleep with my mask and wake up a few hours later and put it on, I find that my AHI from that point forward is ASTRONOMICALLY high.

I have complex sleep apnea, and the best we’ve been able to manage to date is an AHI between 6-8. Not great, but better then the 70+ it used to be…

However, on these aforementioned nights when I’m a dummy and don’t put on my mask, my AHI can then go anywhere between 40 and 60.

Is this a thing?

Like, if you fall asleep and have totally f’ed up breathing for a few hours, does it somehow make it next to impossible to treat once you finally wake up and figure out that you gotta put your mask on?",t2_9esdapl3,0,AHI Worsening Throughout the Night?,[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,110zbz4,True,ElkStraight5202,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/110zbz4/ahi_worsening_throughout_the_night/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/110zbz4/ahi_worsening_throughout_the_night/,35245,1676262429,0,,False,1676262442,1676262442,2023-02-13 04:27:09,,,,,,,
SleepApnea,"5'8"", 210, moderate OSA. However, what I have found so far is that our diagnoses can be subjective. My sleep problems vary night by night. Here's my improvement so far.

Did SnoreLab a few nights before I got my appliance to see how much I snore. This is pretty cool. You not only get the graphs/data, but you can hear subtleties of what goes on during sleep. I was a collapsed-throat type of snorer. Was nice to have a baseline to work with.

Started using the oral appliance type pictured in this link.  
[https://www.smitsdental.com/img/services/dorsal2.jpg](https://www.smitsdental.com/img/services/dorsal2.jpg)  


Snoring almost entirely eliminated. No other issues heard during the recording. First few nights were great. Slept better, felt better in the morning, more energy, fewer headaches. Wasn't hard to get the jaw used to it. A few nights into it, listening to my recording one night, I heard myself shifting some body part after every breath, possibly moving my feet. Restless leg syndrome runs in the family. This led me to learn about Periodic Limb Movement Disorder. Haven't heard any movement since. Several nights later, I heard myself engaging in periods of holding my breath for 10-30 seconds. I would make a few grunts during these episodes, then release my breath with a gasp. This is called catathrenia, which has several interesting influences that do play a role in my life. 1. A habit of strength training where holding the breath is more likely, instead of doing cardio where we use consistent breathing (true). 2. Stress (who isn't stressed in todays crazy world?) 3. Frequent computer use suggests that people unconsciously hold their breath when working under stress; gamers practice deep breathing to combat this during matches. 

I continue to use SnoreLab every night and analyze my performance. I sleep even better when I reduce sugar/caffeine/alcohol, especially at least 4 hours before bedtime.

6-2021; Recall announced 

9-7-21; submitted my claim

9-7-22; 1st year anniversary

10-4-22; First contact from Philips; they wanted to pay me $50 because my device was old.  I had a good laugh and told them I wanted it replaced.  It also continued with ""Philips Respironics team member to call you about obtaining your prescription""; and I bet you already know, but nobody ever contacted me.

10-11-22; I switched to an S-11 unit, until this time I used the Philips unit.

11-30-22; new leadership ""New leadership focused on improving remediation execution""

12-29-22; Our toxic foam has been tested, and everything is fine, dreamstation 1 is good to go, you CAN really trust this time around.

1-31-23; Action needed, we don't have your RX; which doesn't surprise me, as they never called me for the information.  On the bright side, they did and sent the unit with a basic 4-20 cm of H20.

SleepApnea,"Hello!

I’m having a septoplasty in about 14 hours. Terrified. 

Terrified because it is my first time having anesthesia and even going through a surgery, but also some uncertainty around the details of my sleep apnea.


I’ve never done a sleep study, I wake up gasping for air and im tigh-chested occasionally.
But my doc found out i have a deviated septum and need a surgery..

However when I wake up gasping for air it feels like my throat is closing while I sleep. I cant explain it. And im so scared that something like this occurs while im under anesthesia.

Body cant breathe and when i sleep that wakes me up, yet.. not so much if im under anesthesia.

SleepApnea,"I'm going to contact my specialist on Monday, but I'm curious if anyone has experienced this. I started CPAP therapy for OSA about a year ago, and I took to it really well. I sleep through the night and feel great. My sleep study showed an AHI of 47, and since I started CPAP it's consistently under 2. I've also lost nearly 50 pounds in a little over a year, motivated in large part by my diagnosis (specialist told me that if I could lose around 40 pounds we could do another sleep test and go from there, but I haven't done followed up on that yet). I use a Resmed AirSense 11 and a nasal mask. 

Weirdly though, just over the last week I've been getting really dry in my mouth and nose almost every night, to the point where it's waking me up several times a night. My nostrils will hurt inside and my mouth will just be completely parched. I haven't previously had many dryness issues, and nothing has changed with my setup. I've also noticed that my machine the last few days has been putting my central AI score higher than obstructive. Like last night it says my AHI was 0.8 and total AI 0.7, with an obstructive AI of 0 and my central of 0.8. Before the last week I was generally sleeping all night uninterrupted. I don't actually feel more tired than usual, but I'm concerned as to why this is happening seemingly all of a sudden.

I'm partially wondering if with the weight loss and being a year into CPAP it's possible my pressure is now too high and causing issues. My pressure range is set to 6.0-16.0 (set to auto). Last night's pressure topped out at about 11. 

I've never used OSCAR, so I don't have more detailed data, but has anyone else has something like this happen? If so, what ended up helping you?

So my 4 Yr old has been snoring off and on for some time. He has also had a nasal congestion frequently. I just assumed the snoring was because of the nasal congestion. But recently he started bed wetting which he had stopped by 3. And he also has night sweats in the first hour of his sleep. 
The bed wetting I assumed was because he stopped taking naps and sleeps like the dead( who snore) and sweating I assumed was because of over layering or keeping the room too warm.
He has also been having some meltdowns which I thought was because of a new sibling.
But now I read on sleep apnea and feel he might have it. I am taking him to the paediatrician tomorrow but am very worried.

SleepApnea,"Hello

I am wondering what to do about this and whether a sleep study will really help me.

I had a sleep study a while ago because I was snoring some nights and not others and I didn't know what to do so I had the study.

On the night of the study I slept well and didn't qualify as having sleep apnea.

I have continued to be awakend by sleep snoring.  But I have figured out, I think,. - not 100 percent sure here - that when I sleep on my back my head will sometimes tilt to the side.  I have a large neck and I think my breathing gets ""crushed"".  


Should I still go in for a study to rule out everything else?  Would anything even be able to fix this type?

I usually turn over to my side when this happens but lately it has been happening on my side as well.  As stated I think it all has to do with my neck fat.

SleepApnea,"Historically I prefer a higher pillow. Usually I would stack or fold flatter pillows to compensate when my favourite wasn't available. After starting CPAP (and struggling to find stability) I experimented with a flattie, purely out of curiosity. My obstructive apneas were decimated, nearly halving my AHI in the process. 

A week ago I woke up with a painfully stiff neck and decided to try an ergonomic pillow. We had an extra IKEA ROSENSKÄRM to hand, which my wife swears by. So I gave it a try. It felt nice and firm in the backsleeper configuration (lower end under the neck) but my AHI was back up by about 25%. 

It felt so much better for my neck that I gave it three nights for my body to acclimatise, but the number remained elevated. I have my second sleep test coming up (to confirm that my treatment is effective) so I went back to the lumpy cheap pillow. And like clockwork, my AHI went back down.

SleepApnea,"I used to be a professional napper. I could nap any time, any place, and any where. A “quick 45mins” was my go to afternoon / home from work nap and I loved it. I didn’t have any issues sleeping at night either, and would be fast asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. 

In January 2023 something changed. And it felt like mid way through the month I couldn’t sleep properly. I think I went a few days without a nap, felt tired one day, went to nap and couldn’t. And now I can’t sleep at night either. Although I am sleeping as my partner keeps telling me that I’m snoring. 

To describe what’s happening, I close my eyes and relax, trying to fall asleep. With my eyes shut, I see “colours” in the black as my brain settles and I start to fall asleep. There’s a switch at some point as my breathing relaxes and I start to take deeper and deeper breaths. I can “feel” the transition between being awake and being asleep. Sometimes I can feel my eyes roll back and flitter around as my breathing slows and deepens. The transition is a bit like noise cancelling being turned on, and a fuzzy haze feeling. 

And at the point when by I should switch over to being asleep, I feel myself catching my breath, or forgetting to breath in? And I don’t transition over. I can go though this motion again and again each night. It has a weird feeling as it happens. It feels a bit like I’m keeping myself awake, when all I want to do is fall asleep. 

I do sleep, but I wake up not feeling refreshed. And this current situation isn’t sustainable.

SleepApnea,I’ve been experiencing this weird thing when I sleep. It doesn’t happen often but it happens enough that it scares me and I worry if it’s going to happen again when I sleep. It kind of feels like a dream but I also just feel like I am aware it’s happening but I’m still asleep. I tend to hold my breath in my sleep and I don’t know why. I thought it was a sleep paralysis thing because I’m awake and aware I’m doing it but I can’t make myself breath until I almost pass out. But also my head will rapidly jerk to the side when this is happening. Usually in phases of 3 ticks. But it happens for a duration of 15 minutes and eventually I fall back asleep. I had a neurologist for chronic migraine but she recently dropped me as a patient because I missed two appointments in a row so I don’t even have her to talk to. I just don’t know where to start.

SleepApnea,"Hi everyone,

I need some advice because I'm getting really sick with the experiences I've been having with various cpap masks.

Basically I can't stand noisy masksa and I can't stand wind hitting me while I'm trying to sleep.
Also I need good pressure going into my nose, I can very easily feel like there is not enough air entering my lungs. 

I have tried various masks, mainly from Resmed and they all have something that drives me crazy.

The nose ones with one air exhaust at the front are pretty comfy and quiet with one tiny air exit and the flexible tube at the front doesn't feel intrusive, but they feel like there isn't enough air entering my lungs, which feels horrible.

The nose pillow masks, when positioned correctly feel like they deliver enough air to my lungs, but they can be noisy and they often move around so I have to readjust them, it's even worse when I wake up feeling like I can't breathe properly because the mask isn't in the correct position.
A lot of them have minimal straps as well which makes them very prone to leaks if I move a little bit.
Also, some of them vibrate as the air moves which drives me crazy. 

The masks that have the hose connected to the top of the head are horrible because they are noisy, especially with the air traveling right next to the ear, and they have two air vents and the top one always shoots air on my pillow or the wall above my head and make even more noise.

Full face masks cause me chest and stomach pain, I think because I swallow air.

Also, the more joints and moving parts the mask has, the more prone they are to leak air through them and when that air hits my face or arm, it drives me nuts. 

Now I've been looking at two masks on the internet:

The F&amp;P Pilairo Q looks good but I'm worried it will keep vibrating too much when the air passes through those prongs, and I'm worried I won't adapt well to the prongs.

The F&amp;P evora Nasal mask, seems interesting as well but I'm worried that, because it shoots air in all directions, that it's gonna be hard to avoid the air hitting me, or hitting the pillow making noise when it does.

I'm not sure what to do because my cpap clinic doesn't have a huge range of masks and most of them are resmed.

I'd really appreciate some advice here because I've been on cpap for over a year and feels like it causes me more issues than it helps.

SleepApnea,"I started on CPAP therapy in 2009. I lost 200+ pounds between then and 2012, and stopped using the machine for a few years. Like many, the struggle is real and slowly I gained back over 100 of the weight. Two years ago I realized I was exhausted all the time and wow, maybe I should start with what worked - use the damn machine.

It's been a struggle. But until recently I didn't know why.  My machine, an older DeVilbiss Intellipap (an autopap device), was failing in ways that just were not obvious. I assumed it was user error when I saw 100% leak rates for the entire session, like I just wasn't fitting the mask right, and that led to 6 months of trying new masks, different styles, etc.  Then, one day, I went to look at the data and it said AHI 0. Insert cartoonish ""WhAAAaAAaAAA?"" here. That makes no sense.

This goes on for a few nights, and I was so sleepy and braindead I didn't notice THE PRESSURE NEVER CHANGED. It came in at minimum and stayed there. Meanwhile, my O2 ring was telling me I was dropping as low as 74% at various points in every given night.

I started digging and realized that the sensors in the machine were failing. Likely failed completely. I looked back on some older data and lo and behold, I can pinpoint the date - in August of 2022. 

I decided a new machine was in order. ResMed AirSense10 AutoSet, the card-to-cloud one. I just figured I could save a few dollars by not getting the cellular one, and the machine has good reviews everywhere. New, made in 2022 if I'm reading the serial right, and I got it on enough of a discount that it was less than my insurance co-pay for DME.

OH MY GOD WHAT A DIFFERENCE.  First of all, the ability to control the relief pressure when exhaling is amazing. The heated tube is something I never knew I needed. The ability to set the pressure changes from standar to soft is exactly the thing I needed to *stay* asleep. I've had a week of 6+ hours of actual sleep every night. Averaging about 7.5 hours right now. O2 reading never drop below 90% and averages around 97%. It's a world of difference numerically. AHI is around 2.4, with Hypopneas never lasting more than a couple of seconds. 

I actually feel better than I have in years. I have actual energy. I find myself kind of raring to do things right after morning coffee, which is not a feeling I've had in a long, long time.

If you are struggling...check every reading you can get. OSCAR is a godsend.

SleepApnea,"Woman, 37.
Was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea (AHI 71) last September. Mostly hypopneas. I was given a resmed 10 nasal pillow device and slept OK with it for 2 weeks. I did get a stuffy nose and my asthma worsened but after 2 weeks I felt OK.
Then I received a new resmed 10 cause the other one was owned by the sleep clinic. And I started sleeping with it. Used the same nasal pillow mask and started having severe dizzyness and excruciating headaches upon waking up.

Mind you I've never felt tired, the reason I had a sleep study done is because I would wake up with very dry mouth and sometimes I had hot flashes. But I started getting panic attacks, anxiety attacks and chronic pain everywhere. Like my muscles aren't well rested. 
The partner I had at the time has been with me for many years and never noticed sleep apnea before 2021. Only in 2021 he complained of my not breathing properly during the night. I never snored. 

I figured out I have a deviated septum on the right side. Saw 3 ENTS. None of them say this can cause headaches and they don't know for sure if it's the cause of my dizzyness. I can get surgery for it but I'm reluctant. 
I do have a perforated eardrum on the left side and I believe this can cause dizzyness. Yet no ENT thinks that might be the problem. (those were ENTS from multiple hospitals) 

As soon as I sleep with cpap I wake up severely dizzy (not spinning dizzyness but more very lightheaded) with eye pressure and facial pressure. The headache is like the worst ever. My eyes hurt. 

I've seen a optometrist. He says I have perfect vision
I've seen the ENT for a sinus CT. No sinus issues. 
They do suspect a form of trigemanial neuralgia and occipital neuralgia but neurologist can't connect this to sleep apnea or cpap use. 

When I use it I wake up with dizzyness that is so bad I can't get out of bed. I can only lay still in bed hoping I will survive the next hour. So I had to stop cpap. 

I was told a mra splint for sleep apnea isn't a good idea cause I already have jawpain. 
A full face mask is tricky and at my own risk cause I have epilepsy as well. Neurologist says it can get dangerous if I get a seizure during the night. At least one airway needs to be open. 

I feel my perforated eardrum might be the cause of the dizzyness but since no ENT thinks this I really don't know what to do. 

I am currently very tired. And sleep deprived. I wake up with neckpain, face pain, headaches and dizzyness. Without cpap now as well. 
I guess without it, it's the sleep apnea, with it, my eardrum is the problem. I can't get it to work. And the sleep clinic has no idea. 

All they say is that dizzyness isn't a symptom and that the headaches should leave me as soon as I wake up. But they stay with me the entire day. 

I researched dizzyness and found many ppl on this sub who suffer it. And Mr google also tells you that sleep apnea can cause dizzyness and cpap treatment can as well. But my sleep clinic really makes me believe I'm the crazy one. 

We tried every setting on the cpap. And every pressure. After sleep study pressure was adjusted 4-8. It never went anywhere past 6.

Would a full face mask be worth a shot if the dizzyness is caused by the perforated eardrum? 

I'm at my wits end. I'm not sleeping and it's ruining my life. The weird thing is, is that last Sept when I was diagnosed I wasn't tired or dizzy at all. This started when using cpap. And remained without cpap. What the hell is going on? My bloodwork has been done by my gp and neurologist. Nothing weird was found so far. They really have no clue on my dizzyness. 

I mean.. That nose mask is blowing trough my nose the entire night. It seems plausible that this can cause Eustachian tube dysfunction with a perforated eardrum, right? Yet ENT doesn't think so. 

I'm seeing a gnatologist for my jaw and neckpain. I suffer tmjd as well. But I don't clench or grind. I traveled across the country to see her cause she supposedly is the right person if there's jawpain and sleep apnea. But she has no clue. So now I don't have a clue. She thinks my jawpain comes from my neck. So more like referred pain. 

😭😓 I'm lost. Should I go with the mandible? It will never stop the apneas but even if it goes down to 30 AHI I'm happy for now. I need some sleep. My body is breaking down. And some is better than none. 

I'm contemplating if I should get my eardrum fixed. I hate surgery and had surgery in 2021 for endometriosis and I somehow believe the anesthesia gave me sleep apnea. Cause that's when I started waking up with a dry mouth. I was very sick after the surgery. 
So going for another surgery with general anesthesia is scary. I was told they can only do it with general anesthesia. 

I'm at my wits end. I feel I've tried it all and I've seen every specialst there is. A cardiologist as well cause I had heart palpitations. Those dissappeared. But I was told I am fine.

SleepApnea,"Awhile ago I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, mild sleep apnea, constantly being dead tired after a full nights sleep, I did a sleep test and discovered the apnea (also noted by my partner telling me i snore and sound like im gasping for air sometimes). The sleep doctor let me get a cpap and scheduled a sleep test with a cpap on.

I completed that sleep test the other month

In my follow up appointment, the doctor also reviewed all the information from my cpap and said it looked good, and im averaging 2-4 AHI per night, yet im still dead tired most days

He wants me to go see an ENT doctor and prescribed me modafinil to try and see if it helps

I will start taking it tomorrow 100mg in the mornings

I use a whoop wristband to track my sleep, and in the last 6 months, my average sleeping heart rate gradually went from 53 to 70 and heart rate variability went from 100-150 to 25-50. That’s how I knew something was up.

I got a sleep study 3 years ago that turned out fine (AHI of 3, O2 Sat of 94) but decided to retest. This time I had moderate to severe sleep apnea (AHI of 30 andO2 sat of 81).

I’m groggy until at least noon most days and can sleep 10 hours on my off-days and still not feel refreshed. 

I should be getting my CPAP next week and I’m so excited to wake up refreshed again so I can hit the gym without grinding my way through my program. I’m also hoping I’ll have more energy to study for a promotion opportunity I’ve been working towards.

I’m very comfortable wearing a mask since I’ve been wearing an SCBA mask for 13 years at work. I can sleep through anything. I’ve literally slept through earthquakes and I can sleep through my dog jumping on top of me.

Sleep hygiene is all of the recommended behaviors and environmental factors that affect your sleep in order to improve your sleep quality. After evaluating your sleep disorder, your doctor will give you information about some behavioral recommendations and precautions.

SleepApnea,"Background: 35M, BMI 35

I've had a suspicion that I had sleep apnea for a couple of years, I've always been a snorer and my spouse has witnessed me stopping breathing when I was asleep. But it was after a couple of instances of waking up hyperventilating that I asked my doctor for a sleep study.

Unfortunately, I had to reschedule once, but finally got in for the study a few weeks ago. It wasn't a horrible experience, just felt like I only got light sleep. Well, it was a split-night. Turns out, my AHI was 53 before they put the CPAP on half-way and went down to almost zero afterwards. So, I was definitely getting a CPAP.

Well, I just picked the machine up yesterday, an Airsense11 with F30i full mask. I was geeking out with the bluetooth and myAir app before bed. I fell asleep pretty easily, don't remember waking up during the night, and woke up around my normal time in the morning. I looked at the app and it says I kept it on for almost 7 hours. The seal had a good fit and I only had 3 events per hour. When I woke up, I don't know to explain it, but something just felt different.

I feel clearer headed. Like I'm just a bit more with it, more alert. Things are a little brighter and clearer. It's been a while since I have felt this well rested, I can't believe I went so long without getting help. I'm planning on using this new feeling to get into shape. I want to eat better and exercise more. I'm hoping to use this as the first step to getting my health back, for myself and my family.

So, my questions are: Did anyone have an experience like this the first night? Is it just a honeymoon period and does this positive feeling fade? I'm sure I'll struggle at times, but I really hope to keep this momentum going. Any advice to handle the ups and downs moving forward?",t2_3ygl3,0,First night on CPAP.

2 months ago I got a Wellue SleepU to track my sleep. The reports show that almost every night my SpO2 drops to \~85% a few times. For example, here's my last night's report: [https://imgur.com/a/kpq3mVv](https://imgur.com/a/kpq3mVv)

Another one: [https://imgur.com/a/NlrtMkU](https://imgur.com/a/NlrtMkU)

The doctor immediately dismissed the possibility of sleep apnea, stating that it's a disease that only older, overweight individuals with short necks get. He went as far as to say that the SpO2 drops in my oximeter sleep reports are inaccurate, and dismissed my concerns without a proper evaluation.

I was shocked and frustrated by the doctor's response. As far as I know, sleep apnea can affect people of all ages, sizes, and neck lengths, and the fact that my doctor was basing his diagnosis solely on outdated stereotypes is concerning. I also know of multiple people, including my own father, who was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea in his early 30s.

SleepApnea,"

I have been using my AirCurve10 VAuto for about 8 months now. It has helped immensely, as I am down from 59.8 AHI to between 2 to 9 AHI.  The higher end of that usually due to mask leak. And this is why I am coming to you.

I don't know what stats to provide, but I do know that the pressure on my machine is set quite high and the mask I use has been so-so in terms of comfort. I have a permanent red mark across the bridge of my nose and often get nosebleeds or get woken up because air escaping from the mask wakes me up. I am using the full-face F20 ResMed mask, which works reasonably well, and I just replaced the headgear and cushion recently but it hasn't made much a difference in comfort. I also have an F30i, which I use if the bridge of my nose is cut/split to let it heal, but it is much worse for leak even though comfort level is excellent.

I feel like I am rambling. So summary:

I sleep on my side, breathe through my mouth 99% of the time, so I need a full-face mask that is comfortable. I feel like I have to strap the F20/F30i masks so hard to keep it from leaking that it is not comfortable. If anyone is in a similar situation, I would love any suggestions to increase my comfort when using the BiPAP.

SleepApnea,"I’m wondering if anyone has any tips to manage a suspected sleep apnea case before a formal diagnosis?

Some background : I got Covid January 2022 and I think it triggered a number of chronic conditions I’m still dealing with. I got treated for dysautonomia and am taking beta blockers , which have helped a lot but I still have pretty severe brain fog and tiredness which makes it tough to work and live a normal life. I and my doctors suspect I also have some type of sleep disorder; my snoring has gotten much worse since getting Covid, I can never sleep all the way through the night, my blood oxygen levels fluctuate and all my other symptoms get worse when I have a particularly bad night sleep and don’t tend to improve throughout the day. 

I have an in lab sleep study scheduled for the 22nd but I know there can still be a delay between reviewing the results with the doctor and possibly getting the CPAP and then adjusting to it and getting the setting right. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for improving day to day life until then? I’ll try sleeping on my stomachs or elevated and I’ve been eating better and exercising but results are limited so far.

SleepApnea,"I am supposed to be getting one and likely going to be in 1-3 months just don't have the final date set. Worth mentioning i don't have a sleep study yet, the wait list where I live for public health insurance option is over a year and I've been on it for about 5 months. 

But a lot of signs of sleep apnea and most notably my tonsils became permanently enlarged after two infections I got back to back about 7 months ago, which is exactly when these symptoms started. But they give me a ton of trouble and they look awful, feel like they're squeezing a lot of the time and even when I'm awake they almost give me a snoring sound sometimes if I take a sudden breath which is embarrassing when people hear it. So sleep apnea or no i gotta get them out. But I do tend to believe I have it, just waiting for sleep study and if the surgery doesn't work I'll probably just pay for a private test myself to either see or rule it out

SleepApnea,"Hello Reddit Users!!

I have thought for years I may have sleep apnea, but never went to get diagnosed because A) I don't think I can wear something like that one my face all night. B) I was fearful for my license,  I have a commercial license and didn't want to jeopardize it. C) Being single, I wonder if the stigma around these machine scares off potential love interest. I don't drive commercial vehicles anymore (tractor-trailer) but I still must maintain my licence for my management and training positions at work. Now that I have gotten tested, the doctor tells me I only have a few options 1) I get a CPAP machine 2) I can do a test that measures if I can stay awake (I don't sleep when driving but they test for this) and 3) He is under the obligation to report me to the MOT (DMV) and they may take my licence (crap! I knew this would happen when I got tested..  I put myself into this jackpot)

Anyhow, despite all of the above I decided to get tested anyhow and now I have been diagnosed with severe apnea. My AHI is 49 which the doctor states is pretty severe, I have very fragmented sleep, I move around and kick a lot while sleeping. My oxygen level gets down to 70% as the lowest and this is generally when I am sleeping on my back. The reason I decided to get tested was waking up at night gasping for air on occasions feeling like I am going to die, living alone with no one to help, I have had 2 really scary moments and 1 of those times I thought I might pass out.. very scary!  The other reason is even if I get 8hrs of sleep, throughout the day I feel tired and sometimes I don't want to do much,  I guess this is due to my fragmented sleep. Usually when I wake up gasping for air, I also can taste vomit and I don't know if that's the Apnea or acid reflux

Anyhow that's a little about me and how I get here today. In a way I regret doing the test and then on the other hand I know the risk if I don't go treated, and by risk I mean to my life not my licence. The doctor talked about going into cardiac arrest and the possibility of dying in my sleep, so that's a little eye awakening and scary as well. 

So I am in Ontario (Canada) and the government has a program (ADP - Assistive Devices Program) that covers 75% of the device and the ADP approved stores have a cap of $554cdn on all devices. My employment insurance covers the rest of the machine.  So I have a few questions.

\- Have I done the right thing, is a Apnea machine going to solve my problems? Is it life changing? My doctor doesn't understand why I would want to get the staying awake test done and not get a machine if I passed that test to keep my licence without a machine needed.

\- Since I move around a lot during sleep, I start off on my side usually (unless I am using my g-gravity setting on my adjustable bed which I am on my back) but I sometimes wake up and I am on my back. I'm concerned about ripping the mask off (I have a eye mask and it usually falls of too!) or breaking the hose or rip the machine of the night stable. Anyone have these issues?

\- Was is the preferred mask for people who side sleep, back sleep, move around a lot etc.? What are the types of mask - full face, nostril mask etc..? All I can think off is hospital ventilators when I think this mask, and I have had a few on over the years and I don't like them. Full face mask -- Luke... I am your father... haha

\- Since the ADP registered stores are capped on machine price, which machine would be best? I was debating between the Airsense 10 and the Airsense 11 - My dad just got the Airsense 10 and I think his model is the Card-to-Cloud or do all models have cards? Either way I think his doesn't have connectivity. 

\- Which machine would be better - CPAP, APAP or BIPAP? From my current research into the machines it seems that the APAP machine is best because it's constantly auto-adjusting pressure as you sleep. From my understanding the APAP machine can be a CPAP machine but a CPAP machine can't be a APAP machine. And the BIPAP is similar to the CPAP.  Before this, I only ever though it was all CPAP.  Is the correct term PAP and the C/A are just different way machines deal with the Apnea?

Share your positive stories - I need some boost of confidence that I did the right thing and that this isn't the end of the world. 

Age: 40 / AHI: 49 / OXYGEN: 70-80%

SleepApnea,"New CPAP user (about a week).  When I went to the CPAP/mask appointment with the respiratory therapist, she said if I was a mouth breather, I needed to pick one of the full face masks.  I nearly lied because the nasal pillows look so much less intrusive.  But, I owned up to mouth breathing and got the full face mask.  I wake up with the driest mouth I have ever had - way more dry than sleeping with no mask. I've upped the humidity, but that hasn't helped at all. The My Air app doesn't show leaks, and I've been scoring 90-100. I've checked out historical posts in this sub, and I see that people with this problem have used a chin strap or tape with the nasal tape.  I'm open to trying that, but I'm really not interested in using a chin strap with the full mask as there is already stuff strapped to my face.

SleepApnea,"Not looking for concrete answers here, just need to vent. I've been going through the worst period of insomnia of my life the past few months. Now that I'm through the worst of it, I'm more hellbent than ever on getting my shit together when it comes to my sleep issues.

I'm 30M and very thin, about 135 currently. I've had 6-ish sleep studies in total between age 19 and 26 and I'm not convinced a single one of them has provided an accurate assessment of my sleep issues due to me barely fucking sleeping during any of them, due to major anxiety about being watched in my sleep and hooked up to a bunch of wires. Here's my timeline:

2011: barely slept but was somehow diagnosed with severe OSA. Went back for a second study using CPAP and again barely slept. I suspect they never figured out the right pressure for me- when I was attempting to wear the CPAP it would fill me up with air and I'd wake up feeling bloated and having to burp it all out. Eventually gave up after about a year of really spotty usage.

2016: finally decided to get a second opinion since I was still feeling so tired and unable to concentrate during the day at this point. Was given Ambien to help me fall asleep during this study and the results turned out completely clean- no significant apneas/hypopneas to even be diagnosed with anything. Out of all the studies I've had, I think I slept the longest and the heaviest during this one since I remember dreaming and waking up.

2018: still feeling exactly the same, tired and fatigued, moody, anxious, difficulty concentrating. Went to yet another doctor for one last shot at an opinion. They immediately pointed out in my consult that I seem to have a lot of tissue in my throat/epiglottal area that could be causing my issues and thought I'd be a good candidate for a dental device since OSA is so unusual for people my age and weight. Started with a take home test, had a horrific night of anxiety and did not sleep a wink. Then went to their lab in person, was given Ambien, barely slept and didn't even make it into REM, but they concluded I have mild UARS and that a dental device would be a good starting point.

2019: got the device from my dentist, and was given a take home sleep study to test it out. The first night I couldn't sleep with the study and ripped it out, but the next I managed to get a decent amount of sleep while wearing the study gear and the dental device. The report on this one showed no significant apnea found, apparently showing that the dental device works.

Today: I struggled with the pain of wearing the dental device and eventually gave it up and resigned myself to just dealing with these constant sleep interruptions until I'm dead. I normally never have trouble falling asleep, only staying asleep. But after dealing with the worst bout of anxiety-fueled insomnia I've ever had back in December, I've reevaluated the importance of getting quality sleep and how badly it screws me up when I'm lacking it, so I'm back at it and wearing the device during the day to get acclimated to it and am eventually planning on wearing it through the night.

SleepApnea," Hello, I would like to share my experience with my sleep apnea and some ideas that have helped me improve this situation, my quality of sleep (and probably reduce my AHI). Two years ago, I felt quite tired, I had the impression of being badly awakened every day with sometimes migraines. I was very slow in everything I did. I saw a sleep specialist and I have polysomnography. Result: Moderate apnea (obstructive and central) with an AHI of 23. 

So I started treatment with a CPAP. Even though I had better concentration, I was still physically tired and it was very difficult to breathe with it, especially since I had gotten used to breathing through my mouth. So I started looking for complementary ""treatments"" by reading a lot of scientific articles. Of course, this is a very personal case and it will not necessarily work on other individuals. 

1) I started doing myofunctional therapy exercises for several months and the correct positioning of my tongue for example. 20 mins/day

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdRmsJYb8\_Y 

2) I bought a didgeridoo, and I started to play 10 to 20 min also per day when I can. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360393/ 

3) I started doing sports on a regular basis (hiit at home and cycling), 1 to 2 times a week. I'm very little sporty type, I spent 10 years without doing any sport. A very interesting study on hit: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29616142/ and another promising 

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05311280 

4) I also changed lifestyle habits: 

\- I use a light therapy lamp in the morning 20-30 minutes 

\- I stopped coffee/tea after 12:00 p.m. and limit myself to two cups/day 

\- I have stopped smoking 

\- Yoga, stretching and relaxation almost every evening 

5) Something I haven't tried yet: Respiratory muscle training ""RMT"". 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4863204/ 

https://www.scielo.br/j/bjmbr/a/nNPGzCYGQz58ZDgrxCYY5nR/# I just bought a breathing exerciser. I think it can be very interesting to try. 

**If anyone has any other leads and advices, I'm all ears!** 

Interesting thing: 8 months ago I did a new polysomnography (without CPAP). Result: 7.2 AHI. In recent months, I feel much better, with more energy.

SleepApnea,"Hi friends,  

I recently borrowed a CPAP machine (Dreamstation) on a temporary basis while I wait for my sleep study, which is scheduled for the end of March. I've used it about 10 nights so far, but have only slept with it on for a max of 2 hours one night--typically 0-1hr. I have been troubleshooting the last 2 weeks and I think I have my pressure (7.5-14, flex 3), mask size and humidity comfortable enough to sleep...the problem seems to be my tongue.  

I've tried the nasal cushion and pillows and find both to be comfortable. BUT, I'm prone to chipmunk cheeks/air puffs through my mouth just as I start to fall asleep, which wake me up over and over. I'll go to bed, put on the mask, and an hour + later I'm still awake. I tried a cervical collar, but it was uncomfortable and didn't prevent my issue. My mouth is closed, but it feels so dry, like it's full of cotton. I say all this because I'm not a mouth breather, but I think my tongue is dropping from the roof of my mouth and causing air to enter my throat/mouth. When I'm awake, I have proper tongue placement (roof of mouth). My ENT told me I have a large tongue and small jaw and suspected UARS, but we'll see in March.  

ANYWAY (sorry), might a full face mask help in this case? I know I'm probably just going to have to deal with the dry mouth, and that's fine, I can get xylimelts or whatever. My main issue is the lack of sleep. Can a FFM help me avoid the air puffing issue that I'm having? I'm assuming that type of mask won't cause me to wake me up if my tongue drops and air comes into/out of my mouth? If so, I'll order one and do tongue exercises while I wait. :)

SleepApnea,"Hello. This is my first post here.

For about a year now, I've been worrying that I have had symptoms similar to that of sleep apnea.  Nonstop tiredness, brain fog, and cognitive impairment that has steadily worsened.

I've been told by my partner that I breathe through my mouth when sleeping on my back and snore quite loudly. Sometimes it also sounds like I'm gasping for air when I mouth-breathe on my back. However, they didn't say they heard episodes of no breathing. 

So, a few months ago, I did a home sleep test. ([This is the one I used](https://shop.edensleep.co.nz/basic-home-sleep-test-resmed-onesleeptest/))

Here are the results that I got: [https://imgur.com/a/hqSHt5Y](https://imgur.com/a/hqSHt5Y)

&amp;#x200B;

According to the sleep specialist, my results are not indicative of someone who has sleep apnea. However, I still wanted to try using a CPAP machine. So I tried one for about 2 weeks. I don't think I managed to get a single full night's rest using the CPAP machine. I only ever managed to get 4 hours of sleep at once, and then I'd have to take it off and resume sleeping. But even with those nights the CPAP machine seemed to make no difference.

&amp;#x200B;

The sleep study would cost me thousands of dollars, so I wanted to know if there is any chance of having sleep apnea, despite the results that I got, before spending all that money.

SleepApnea,"Hi all. This is not a sales pitch or a scam, I’m just relaying my recent experience with a device called eXciteOSA. 

It is not recommended for more severe sleep apnea and I’m only posting about my own personal experience and something of a success story with this device:

I have an AHI of 25. I am not overweight and am physically active. Have no ongoing health or mental health issues. 

eXciteOSA - a device that you wear for 20mins daily, before sleep, that stimulates your tongue muscles through small but tolerable electric shocks - recommends their device for mild SA only. My AHI is not necessarily in the mild category but I wanted to try it as it has a 5-week money-back trial period. After 6 weeks the schedule is 2x weekly, not daily. 

They offer a payment plan of £15/month (UK) - my logic was that I was loosing way more than this in loss of income due to sleep apnea. 

I had failed getting used to CPAP twice despite persisting with it as much as possible and making adjustments with guidance from the NHS sleep team. The eXciteOSA device takes some getting used to and is a little unpleasant to start with, but you can programme the device from an accompanying phone app and start on a low current. It works by strengthening your tongue muscles including at the back of your mouth/throat, and helps from having your throat collapsing at night causing apneas. 

After 2-3 weeks I noticed a big difference. I am recalling dreaming for the first time in years; I don’t wake up feeling groggy and ‘hungover’; don’t wake up repeatedly throughout the night. Generally more refreshed and don’t desperately work my day around sleep, tiredness and fatigue. I’m more productive in general. Oddly, I feel like I can generally breathe better as well including when awake. 

I don’t feel that this has totally eradicated by sleep apnea and accompanying symptoms but it has drastically improved quality of life; sleeping and having to work around the side effects of poor sleep is no longer something I have to negotiate with or make plans around.

I started doing some things to try to adjust and the past two nights I’ve had problems with the seal. Last night I got fed up and just took off the CPAP after 3 hours and this morning all my sleep data on my Garmin is dramatically better!

SleepApnea,I have looked around and there are so many masks for CPAP machines! And machines themselves! How do you decide? And is there some kind of trial period for the masks? Is there some place you can go to test them? I probably won't be able to do just nasal pillows or cushions because I don't have a great nasal airway (I've had 2 surgeries for deviated septum and still can't breathe through my nose very well).

SleepApnea,"Thanks everyone for the comments and help on my last posts. This is an update, not sure where to go from here. My girlfriend and I have both had a life time of medical professionals minimising symptoms, palming you off because there’s no good results to go off of or even what feels like some internal bias. It’s really hard not to have an answer and you know something is wrong but you’re “fine”.

Symptoms that I’ve witnessed and noticed from her: snoring very loud (like my grandma who smokes and has apnea), whole body spasms, waking up randomly, waking up with anxiety, waking up unrefreshed, family history of apnea, difficulty paying attention, difficulty getting to sleep, vivid nightmares 

Here’s the sleep study results: 
Sleep: Lights out @ 12:30hrs. Sleep onset = 22.0 mins. Latency to REM sleep = 181.0mins. Slow wave sleep proportion = 20.7% and REM sleep proportion = 12.3%. Sleep efficiency =
91.7%. The EEG arousal index = 8.3, most often associated with limb events.
Respiratory: There were 0 obstructive apnoeas, 0 mixed apnoeas, 1 central apnoeas (average duration = 12 secs) and 22 hypopnoeas (average duration = 23secs) recorded. The overall AHI =
3.2, supine AHI = 3.2, supine REM AHI = 9.0 and REM AHI = 9.0. A total of 435.0mins of supine sleep were recorded, with 53.5mins of supine REM. Soft snoring was recorded continuously
throughout. Mean awake Sa02 = 95%, nadir Sa02= 92%.
Total number of Limb movements = 359, PLMS index = 13.2 with a PLMS arousal index of 0.3/hr
and 1 isolated limb movement arousals. Possible artefact see bookmark below. Average heart rate = 61 bpm.

Sleep doctor:
I'm been told try sleeping more, spend 1600 on further testing on sleep testing (he thinks it would be a waste tho) see his dentist friend on the GC spend 1500 on a mouthguard looking thing to pull my lower jaw forward to help the snoring or get an apple watch to manage my sleeping better …He also said my symptoms do have a lot in common with being very depressed.

SleepApnea,"Hi,
I’m interested in the EASE procedure with Kasey Li, and I recently called for an estimate, and had a very frustrating conversation with someone at his office. I asked about how billing works with and without insurance, and this woman would not explain what my options were. Said there was only one option, then explained two. Then I got sent two scanned pdfs over two emails, with a ton of information poorly formatted and circled and crossed out. Normally, this would be a huge red flag for me and I wouldn’t want to trust them for a surgery, but he’s one of the best in the world for a reason. 

So, my first question is, what the fuck is up with his office people? This was horrible. She wouldn’t even explain the process to me or what my insurance (Dr. Li even said he works with my plan a lot) tends to approve and when, and the pdfs she sent were so disorganized. 

And second more important Q, can someone who has tried to get insurance to cover their procedure (especially someone with UARS or Google insurance) explain the process to me? A DM is fine.

SleepApnea,"Hey so I woke up to some bad news today, I probed my doctor to test me a week or two ago due to ongoing concerns where I'm waking up numb and then fainting, he got results and immediately ordered me a cpap machine. I haven't actually seen him but we can pretty much all guess the diagnosis.

Thing is I don't know if it's just sleep apnea but more a conglomerate. I have constant chronic sinusitis that feels like a blockage close to the front of my face, under my nose and above my mouth. I spend a lot of the day coughing due to this.

I thought I would hate the full face mask, but it's actually way, way, way more comfortable than the nasal pillows for me.   With that mask on Monday and Tuesday, I hit the 4 hour mark each night before ripping the mask off.  Progress!

Last night, exactly one week from getting my machine, I fell asleep quicker than ever.  I slept hard.  Mask didn't bother me one bit and I finally made it a full 6 hours.  I woke up today feeling better than I have in god knows how long.  My apnea events are under 5.  It's incredible and I feel amazing.

If you're new to this and struggling with the transition, just keep it up!  Sit in bed with your mask on for 15-20 minutes before you try to sleep.  Turn off any ramp settings to help your body get used to it quicker.  Find a mask that both fits and feels comfortable.  And don't get discouraged if you have a bad night.  It takes time to adjust and you'll get there!",t2_5hkmu,0,First great night with BiPap!,[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,10rzcne,True,atgunner,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/10rzcne/first_great_night_with_bipap/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/10rzcne/first_great_night_with_bipap/,35077,1675368304,0,,False,1675368321,1675368322,2023-02-02 20:05:04,,,,,,,

SleepApnea,"Hello Everyone.  I'm new to the forum and have a question.  Let me explain.  I had a sleep apnea test in 2004.  The results were 11 events per hour, blood oxygen 82%.  The sleep doctor indicated ""no significant obstructive sleep apnea"", possibility of upper airway resistant syndrome with respiratory event related arousals.  As such, there was no foll0ow up or treament by the sleep doctor or my physician at that time.  

So, I went on my merry way thinking ""I don't have sleep apnea"".  Due to snoring that could wake the dead I consulted with an ENT and in 2009 I had surgery to correct a deviated septum (which didn't work).  

Now, over 18 years later I fully understand the problems associated without treatment.  January 2022 I had an eye stroke and that set off a series of tests by various doctors over the last year.  The result of an OSA test in May 2022 indicates severe OSA with 33 events per hour and 82% oxygen.  I have also developed atrial fibrillation, white matter disease, short term memory issues, and executive function problems (planning, thought processing).

I've consulted two attorneys who've indicated that the NYS statute of limitations is 2.5 years and I was told I have no legal recourse.  You don't know how frustrating this is.  For the past twelve months I've been on a restricted diet (a problem for someone who was raised to eat.  I'm Italian but not overweight).  I am also not allowed to operate a vehicle; car motorcycle, or bicycle.

I am very angry that the inactivity of the doctors in 2004 have resulted in these problems, my going on disability, and now six months after that my position needs to be filled.  Forced retirement at 64 years old.

Please, does anyone know if I have any recourse?",t2_4cxslujpd,0,Untreated OSA,[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,10rubse,True,AJR091458,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/10rubse/untreated_osa/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/10rubse/untreated_osa/,35078,1675356190,0,,False,1675356208,1675356208,2023-02-02 16:43:10,,,,,,,

SleepApnea,"I recently got diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. As a 20-something male with healthy weight, the likely cause seems to be a malocclusion that jaw surgery will aim to fix eventually but this has not yet been discussed with the surgeon, to be soon though. More recently I got an Airsense (iIrc) cpap but I've been thinking about my hyperventilation (which occurs during the day at times as well and could be linked to anxiety). But I also tend to wake up in a state of hyperventilation. My concerns are that I'm not sure if this is caused by the apnea or if the apnea is caused by this and I worry that the mask may contribute or worsen it with all the air being sent in. I've been a bit scared to use the mask in general even though it only covers the nose and am looking to alleviate those concerns, I just don't really know what to expect.

SleepApnea,I’m 19 and am perfectly healthy otherwise. My problem is I have a deviated septum and just very little airflow through both nostrils. I was prescribed Flonase for 3 months for inflammation but I highly doubt I should wait for that long. I’m waiting for a sleep study but what if I’m prescribed a cpap when I don’t need one? It seems impossible for doctors to believe my nose is the culprit. I don’t breathe through my mouth when I sleep I just breathe through my nose and I’m having severe symptoms of sleep apnea. I really don’t want to keep waiting I just want a surgery but it seems insurance has to rule out every single other possibility before they spend any real money.

My problem with pillow mask is that after EPAP 7.2 I get chipmunks cheeks, so to higher pressure i need FFM, so I started using F30, F30i with decent leak control, same pressure spikes from machine, disconnected sleep while gradually increasing EPAP, and PS as here:

&amp;#x200B;

so based on previous numbers I got the EVORA mask, and used the 99.5% EPAP for few nights, kept tweaking leaks untill last night i got almost no leaks and almost flat pressure lines, but STILL SAME AROUSALS after a REM cycle, you can notice that machine kept increasing the 99.5% each time so last night the highest EPAP was around EPAP 14, but still in the zoomed in airflow, you could see some limitations followed by arousal without machines detecting any need to increase pressure, these screenshot for last night are my best optimized numbers for the past 3 months yet, I STILL KEEP WAKING UP!

&amp;#x200B;

so right now I am yet at another impasse, I don't think the answer is to increase EPAP more, as you can see in the screenshots:

I tell them nicely that it was over a year and a half ago and I can no longer find my old unit. They told me no replacement without old
 unit. I explained to them that I don’t recall anywhere it said that I needed to return my machine and the this is a medical device I require to possibly stay alive.

SleepApnea,"Hello all, Most of you may have gotten diagnosed with sleep apnea because of very noticeable symptoms... to me it was just exploring o2 levels with a night gadget and wondering how I can optimize my sleep ... which I felt i was given it a self perceived grade grade 7.5 out of 10. 

I took the first days of January to do a confirmed doctor home sleep study, which confirmed 9.6 AHI OSA . Okey, so I then took 3 weeks to get 4 mouthpieces and none of them decreased my sleep apnea. 

So I got the CPAP machine ResMed 11. I got used to it in 4 days (yeah iam fast lol) and AHI is at 0.2 with a ridiculous pressure of 4.  YES THIS WAS A PRODUCTIVE JANUARY LOL :)

I know I must give it time to feel more energy (this was also my concern) ... but my non scientific logic challenges that I got here almost by mistake, almost intuitively... and in my country pretty much nobody has heard of this, or uses it and iam left with the stupid stereotype that it looks like an ICU on my face.

So my question is, is it absolutely CONCLUSIVE evidence that I will have a STRONG PROVEN advantage in my heart, and other possible chronic conditions so that I can stick to it the rest of my life?

SleepApnea,"Hey so I had my first real in house sleep study done about two weeks ago. I had an at home study done about 5 years ago. I went from mild to a big whooping severe case of OSA. My doctor says like it's more than likely my bone structure that is causing it because I'm not considerably overweight. I started going to sleep doctor because I heard of Inspire and frankly I've been ""inspired"" ( don't hate for the pun ). As that seems like the closest to regular sleep than I've ever seen. It's always been about a CPAP and I just can't seem to conform the lifestyle with it. I have tried all the different headpieces as well. The main concern my doctor has is that I'm only 30 and I already have high blood pressure as well (I have the best genetics clearly). I have been so gung ho about Inspire (or at least something similar) that when she mentioned that something like Maxillomandibular Advancement, I was thrown for a loop. Tbh, the more I read about that, the more I'm interested in that as well. Is there any feedback you guys could give me about either one? Or if any of you have similar situations?

SleepApnea,"This month marks my one year anniversary of aPAP therapy and while I feel leaps and bounds better than pre-CPAP, I still feel fatigued, have a tough time staying focused, I'm still pretty forgetful and I still have pretty baggy eyes (though they almost halved in size and darkness). I have a 62.8 AHI, and I suspect I have been experiencing OSA since early childhood as I have a kindergarten photo where I have noticeable eye bags and I just turned 30. I feel like at the rate at which I am improving, it might take another 2-3 years to feel 'normal' which I am pretty happy about, I just which it were a bit quicker!

I also suspect my underlying health issues are slowing the rate in which I heal from using aPAP. 

I have been experiencing GERD for the last 4 months or so, and I most likely suffer from depression and anxiety (probably since early childhood). I'm going to see a therapist to address my mental health.

SleepApnea,"So I got diagnosed using an at-home test, and have never been in the same room with a sleep doc or even a respiratory therapist. I've just had a few phone calls with a sleep therapist. In a few days, I'll have a phone call with an actual sleep doc. 

But here's my situation:  in the sleep study, my supine AHI was about 20. Now that I have a Resmed 10 APAP with full-face mask (f-20?) due to deviated septum, when I go supine, I get an apnea about every 45 seconds (20 seconds of breathing, with the amplitude of the breathing decreasing over that 20 seconds, followed by 25 seconds of not breathing, rinse, repeat).  When I was using the default settings that the machine came with, 4 cm to 20 cm, when I would go supine, I would wake up pretty much as soon as the pressure got to 14 or 16. And then I would take the mask off because the CPAP is not supposed to wake me up when I have an apnea, it's supposed to prevent it. 

So I lowered the max pressure to 10 (and raised the minimum pressure to 7 in order to get my side-sleeping AHI down to essentially zero). With those changes, now when I side-sleep, I'm fine, and when I roll to my back, I still get the apneas every 45 seconds, but the pressure tops out at 10, and it doesn't wake me up. One night I stayed supine like this for over an hour, but usually I roll to a side within ten minutes. 

Part of what it feels like is happening is the full-face mask pushes my mouth open / jaw down and back. This is because of the higher pressure on the front of my face, and also because the silicone of the mask trying to expand outward, in a way that rolls along my jaw, opening it. But the part of pushing my jaw back towards my neck seems to actually close the airway. And that seems kinda dumb. 

Does anyone have any insight into this? Or anything I should specifically ask my doctor besides what I've put here in order to get a more useful visit?

SleepApnea,"Hello everyone, I’m a 26yo female (currently slightly underweight due to an unknown reason being investigated by endocrinology and gastroenterology - awaiting what feels like 838973 tests)

About 2 months ago I started eating in calorie surplus to really try gain weight (didn’t work) however I started experiencing waking up in the night literally choking, gasping for breath, followed by an extremely rapid HR for a min or so, I’d then be terrified to fall back to sleep.. after about 2 weeks of it consistently happening I went to the dr about it (as Dr Google was telling me I had heart failure) my dr reckoned it was reflux related and gave me some advice and I’m assuming because of my weight and medical history didn’t think it was worth worrying about sleep apnea. 

It started going away about week 3 and I haven’t had it since. However this evening I’ve been startled out of my sleep with the exact same again and now I am terrified. I have no idea why it’s happened again and I’m so scared to go back to sleep. I feel like I have a lump in my throat, my stomach feels all gurgly and I feel out of breath (which I’m associating with the sheer panic it gave me!) my voice has been getting progressively more croaky and today/even now I felt just an overall weird chest sensation but put it down to the fact my back muscles are sore AF due to sleeping on a sofa the last few nights until tonight as I was away. 

Does this sound familiar to any of your experiences? I feel so alone with it and any further advice would be great until I can ring my gp in the morning. I don’t think it’s heart related as I’ve had intensive cardiac investigations done before due to a genetic condition that I had to get checked for and I got the complete all clear and discharged (however my anxiety is trying to tell me otherwise)

SleepApnea,"Hi all. I got my cpap machine back in June 2021, i’ve been using it often and it has helped but lately over the past few months, maybe longer I noticed some mild changes in my sleeping habits. I’m more foggy in the mornings, I get drowsy eyes (occasionally, not all the time) when I drive to work at 7am… i could go to bed at 7pm the night before and will still be hitting the snooze button as much as possible when I wake up for work at 6am. It’s starting to really annoy me that I might need my levels changed. I thought maybe it’s because I gained some weight that maybe I need a pressure change? I was at cpap 18, then March of 22 I asked if I could get it lowered because it kept waking me up in the middle of the night, so they changed it to apap 14-18. Now, since I changed it to that I was able to sleep through the night no problem, but since March I have probably put on about 50lbs. Could this weight gain mean I need a pressure change?

SleepApnea,"Tldr; I was in a car accident last year and my license was suspended because the urgent care doctor reported it was due to sleep apnea. How do I get it back? (California)

I woke up around 3 or 4am to drive for uber then around 9:30am I started to head home. It was traffic time and I felt fine. The next thing I know, I rear ended someone and of course pulled over. The police came and so did the ambulance (it was a minor finder bender, traffic wasn't going faster than maybe 30 - 35 mph, but the other party was claiming injuries but the EMTs said they didn't require an ambulance and that if they wanted to, they could drive themselves to the ER). A police report was filed but I was cleared to drive home as well.

I went to urgent care the same day and I was seen by a doctor. I told him I must have fallen asleep at the wheel (I don't recall doing so! But I also don't recall the accident happening/how it happened). The doctor saw on my chart that I MIGHT have sleep apnea (i wasnt diagnosed at the time but was actively working with my PCP to get my sleep study results from the place that conducted it but they wouldnt release it for months for some reason). Skip ahead a few days from the accident and I get a letter from the DMV saying my license was suspended. The urgent care doctor reported I was unsafe to drive due to sleep apnea.

I filled out the medical forms with my PCP and sent it in then waited for my hearing date. I didn't realize I would be sworn in and basically have a trial via phone. I wasn't prepared for a legal proceeding. I thought it would just be some DMV employee going over my doctor's medical forms. They ended up upholding the suspension. 

I contacted lawyers but I couldn't afford them but one let it slip that I could resubmit the medical forms. When I talked to the DMV about it, they said all I had to do was get the doctor to be very specific about what caused the car accident (wouldn't it be speculation? He wasn't there!). I have an appointment with my PCP on Friday. 

I'm looking for any help with how to get it reinstated. I have my cpap machine and am working towards resolving my sleep apnea issue but time isn't on my side. My job requires me to have a license and car (of course car insurance too but they have been amazing and accommodating and let me do admin work in the mean while) plus my car insurance is threatening to terminate my policy unless I can provide forms by March 17th that I am getting my license reinstated.

SleepApnea,"I've been having terrible sleep habits for about 2 years now. I used to take THC oil to help my fall asleep, one night, I took a little too much out of the wrong bottle and tripped out. There was a period where I could not fall asleep, I was so anxious, I went 46 hours without sleep.

My Doctor prescribed me Zopiclone and I take half of one per night (7.5mg / 2 = 3.75mg). I toss and turn in my sleep, and for the life of me I cannot sleep on my back, as I start to feel like I can't breathe. There has been nights where my wife said I wasn't breathing in my sleep. I wake up through the night with a sore chest, and sometimes feels like I wasn't breathing, I don't really know how to describe it. Everyday, I'm tired, I never feel awake.

I recently had a sleep apnea test done. It was a gadget you put on your finger tip for the night. It was determined I do not have sleep apnea (nothing serious anyway) and I'm kind of even more concerned now. I have a VitalSleep mouth guard, which sucks, but it works and this is why I'm convinced I have sleep apnea. When I use it, I am usually more refreshed the next day then when I don't use it. The problem with it though is, it doesn't wanna stay in my mouth most nights and hurts my teeth.

SleepApnea,"1 week and according to my cpap the whole time it has always been 100% sleep apnea. My at home sleep study said it was about 90% OSA and it was wrong . 

Before CPAP I tried 3 different mouthpieces all of them naturally failed . 

The good news is that with just a pressure of 4 my AHI is 1.5 !!! 

I still can't believe this , first that apparently it that expensive sleep study was wrong and second that it required such a low pressure, third 100% CSA is pretty uncommon.  

Initially my sleep study pointed at 9.6 AHI . Could there be a fixable root cause ? Like meds or because Iam taking high does Sertraline... (200mg)?

Thank you.

I'm trying to figure out what's going on. I'm about three weeks into CPAP, and each time I fall asleep, I wake up 4 hours later. My machine is saying 0 AHI's in that 4 hours. My mask fit is 100%. My air pressure is at 8-13. Before CPAP, I was waking up so much at night, sweating, gasping for air, etc. So, at least I'm getting 4 hours of good sleep. I try to fall back asleep with the CPAP on, but can't for some reason, so I take it off and getting about 4 more hours of restless, bad sleep without the CPAP. I've tried keeping the CPAP on even after I wake up after 4 hours, but my sleep is still restless and I wake up like 8-10 times.

Has anyone else had this problem? I talked to my sleep specialist, she said maybe it's anxiety. But, I don't feel anxious. I do have TMJD issues and have wondered if my jaw joint problem could be causing my tongue to be out of place when I sleep, but that's just a theory. If my tongue was blocking my airway, or if something was misaligned, I'd probably see AHI above 0, right?

SleepApnea,"Hi all,

As the title says I'm having this issue where I wake up gasping for air but it only happens in the initial phases of sleep as I begin to drift off and then enter sleep. 

I have had this condition for a couple of years. 

I've never been to see a Dr about this but am booking myself in and will request a sleep study. 

Initially I thought that it was a heart condition, I've  had my heart checked out and all appears to be fine. 

Then I thought it was anxiety, which I do still think is a component of it. 

I then also assumed cos I'm a bigger guy the weight of my body pressing up into my lungs might be the issue and or the Weight of my neck, tongue and around my nose and throat closing off my air ways. I still think that this is a component too. 

I kept a bit of a mental diary and noticed that eating heavy meals or eating late at night effects it and makes it worse as does drinking alcohol, assuming the alcohol relaxes the muscles even more and puts strain on the organs, lungs, heart and blood oxygen, same as with the food putting strain on the body to push blood oxygen to the organs and gut to digest and putting extra weight onto everything. 

The thing is that even if I don't drink or don't eat a heavy meal I get it, which leads me to suspect that it's either a type of sleep disorder Associated with anxiety or it's physiological or a combination of both. 

My wife says that at night I snore really loud and that sometimes it sounds like I stop breathing. 

Obviously I am now going to go get checked out but that may take some time to get booked in for a sleep study. 

Does anyone have similar experience? What ended up happening?

SleepApnea,"Hello all - so I’ve been using my Airsense 11 for about 6 weeks now. I’ve fortunately adjusted pretty quickly and I’ve been using it every night for about 8-9 hours with usually an AHI anywhere from 0.4-1.5. I’ve been very happy so far with the results and feel that my day time symptoms are already beginning to improve. One problem I am seeing however is that when I workout hard at the gym (lifting, cardio, etc.) that night my AHI is raised a few points and my SA symptoms are much worse the next day. It doesn’t happen every time I workout but if I do have a good hard workout, the next morning I am waking up with a headache, the brain fog is back in full effect, I’m exhausted and work becomes much more difficult and my anxiety is much worse. So my question is, has anyone noticed that their sleep apnea is worse on days they either do a lot physically or work out hard? Idk if this is because my body is still healing and I need to slow down the workouts but it’s discouraging when I feel more energy during the day due to CPAP, so I go workout to be healthy and the next day or 2 I am just dragging and my AHI numbers are worse.

SleepApnea,"I got diagnosed with sleep apnea about a month ago, I’ve been using a CPAP machine for two weeks now. Im using this small nasal cushion mask and I sleep on my side.

SleepApnea,"Hi all,

I (27f) was diagnosed in December with mild obstructive sleep apnea. It was somewhat of a relief to know that I wasn't crazy and I have legitimate sleep problems. After receiving my diagnosis I had to wait two months to see the sleep specialist to talk about a  CPAP due to waitlists. I have one month to go before my appointment.

SleepApnea,"I am almost at my 7 month anniversary of starting CPAP. (I started CPAP the night of June 30, 2022.) 

I am recovering from the very first Upper Respiratory Infection that I have had since starting CPAP, and this URI just so happens to be Covid.  I typed ""covid"" into the search function for this board, and I read the results. Someone - or several people - gave the advice that I should try to sleep with the CPAP when possible, which I did. The advise helped tremendously, so thanks for that.

I think that I had Covid once before in very early 2020 when tests weren't available, so I'll never know if that was actually Covid.  In retrospect I most likely had undiagnosed Sleep Apnea back then. 

The present is the first time that I've ever tested positive. (I had a URI in June before I started CPAP, but I tested negative, so maybe that was a cold.) I'm vaxxed and boosted. Whatever I had in early 2020 kicked my butt a lot worse than this illness right appears to be doing. (I am keeping my fingers crossed; hopefully I don't regret speaking too soon.)

Now that  I have been diagnosed with OSA and I have been treating it for the past 7 months, I feel more confident about my body's ability to fight illness.  Sure, I've been sleeping like shit and eating like shit the past few days, but I feel hopeful that the CPAP treatment and some other lifestyle changes that I made in the past year that were connected to starting CPAP (exercise, cutting down on alcohol  and coffee, getting my hypertension under control, etc) are benefitting me right now. Maybe it's just wishful thinking. Still, I feel as if using the CPAP is another tool that I have available to fight illness.

Now that I'm starting to feel better, I need to think about cleaning my CPAP components. I wiped my face mask down this morning with a CPAP wipe. I'm going to rinse out my tube with dish soap and hot water. I'll soak my water chamber with white vinegar.

SleepApnea,"Hi, am curious to know if others have had this experience.

Still fine-tuning pressure on CPAP so I don't doubt that is a factor, but:

I've noticed that my energy levels/sleepiness throughout the day have sort of flipped depending on if I've used the cpap the previous night or not.

When I haven't used it, the pattern is that the morning is when I am most tired and by the evening I feel the most awake. Whereas with CPAP, I am most tired towards late afternoon to evening. To the extent that I feel like I am so exhausted I could fall asleep at 6 or 7! And am most energetic in the morning. 

Basically, have others noticed a shift in energy ups and downs changing drastically? I'm hoping that once I find the right pressure and can maintain it that it'll be more stable throughout and I won't have to experience such severe dips no matter the time.


But I find it interesting that for now, the cpap totally alters the energy levels that I've been used to. If you've also experienced this, I'm curious to know if it improved with the right pressure.

SleepApnea,"Hey yall! Over the past few years, I have had consistent mild brain fog. I always though it was due to heavy nicotine use. I have been off of nicotine for three months, fast forward to today, I have severe brain fog and terrible daytime sleepiness.

Nobody has heard me snore, although I haven woken up to either myself snoring loudly or a choking sensation multiple times.

SleepApnea,"Lurking in this community for a while, I was hoping I might get some advice about how to help myself wait for a CPAP machine (I am diagnosed with severe sleep apnea, machine is ""a month away"" from arriving -- but I'm fear that it will be longer than that).

I bought a VitalSleep Anti-Snoring Mouthpiece, which has helped some.  Before this, I would wake up in a daze that lasted all day; I had headaches almost every day.  Since I have started using the mouthpiece the headaches are more or less gone, but I'm still very tired.  Last night I got an insight into why: I feel as though the mouthpiece helps me breathe when I'm on my sides.  But once I fall sleep, I move to my back, where the mouthpiece doesn't work anymore, and I wake up.  This repeats throughout the night...

SleepApnea,"So I have been recently diagnosed with sleep apnea, but I am struggling to understand why this all has started for me, and wanted to know if anyone here could help.
My sleep apnea started very suddenly for me 9 months ago following a pretty intense night at work. I even felt some psychological sensations that night that freaked me out.
I decided not to take it too seriously, but ever since, I started waking up several times throughout the night.
I eventually got diagnosed with sleep apnea, but the doctors don’t seem to have an answer for why it happened suddenly. They only seem to care that I have it, and not the why I have it.

Another weird thing about it all.. ever since the event, I don't seem to really get tired. The sleep apnea obviously causes me to get fragmented sleep. And some nights I end up not being able to go back to sleep all together, leaving me with 3-4 hours of sleep to run my day off of.
Despite this, I never find myself being particularly tired. 3-4 hours of sleep before all of this would have felt completely killer, and I would most definitely feel dead tired until I crashed early into the day, but I do not experience this now.
Is it common for sleep apnea to start so suddenly? Did the intense night at work have anything to do with it?
Also, does anyone else experience not being tired?

SleepApnea,"I'm eight months into trying to make things work with a Resmed CPAP, mostly using a nasal mask, and really losing hope. Please note that the problem I'm describing here, or at least a lot of it, happens  when I'm dosing off or fully asleep so this can't be as precise or definite as I'd  like.

Starting last September (so when the air was still relatively moist--I'm in New England) I started having occasional nights when I'd wake up with mouth and nasal passages painfully parched. We started then playing with things: humidity, tube temperature (to decrease condensation), and pressure. The problem got worse in the  fall and has in the past month or two happened almost every time I've tried use it, maybe because the air got dryer--BUT it's also happened recently when I've tried running a humidifier and air in the room was definitely moist. And last night it happened again and so I took the thing off...but the machine didn't turn off and in the morning the tube and mask were full of condensation. What I've noticed a couple of times recently, with humidifier on and machine set at high humidity, is that the air almost feels too cool, maybe more so than being dry, as I'm going off to sleep--and there's also just a lot of air flow (even with pressure being recently reduced) which makes it feel aggravating. But still, last night I woke up after an hour parched. The most confident thing I can say is that my nasal passages feel  really uncomfortably stimulated by some combination of  cool/dry/airflow. 

The problem has also happened with a full face mask and with my mouth taped shut, so I don't think mouth breathing is the problem and my doc tends to agree. The whole situation is made worse by my having developed great difficulty getting back to sleep with the thing on after waking (which happens  consistently and usually within 90 min of falling asleep) even regardless of the dryness problem. I think I had five days last July of really feeling like I'd gotten the hang of this thing, and it just hasn't worked since then. Thankfully my apnea is mild, but almost all of it is in REM sleep and it's still enough that I have stretches or cycles with many mornings feeling just awful when I wake up--and sometimes when waking at night, I'm sure because of lack of oxygen. 

I'd sure appreciate any help or advice on this. Is it possible the machine is defective?

SleepApnea,"So seems like I don't have apnea, but I was curious if someone could possibly explain some things to me in my sleep study report. I wasn't able to get a follow up with my Sleep Doctor for \~2 weeks so I'm trying to get some thoughts prepared for when I see them.

Some highlights from the report:

**Sleep Data:**

The patient was monitored for a total of 558.5 minutes, out of which the patient slept for 369.0 minutes. Sleep efficiency was 66.1%.

**Respiratory Data:**

During the study there were 0 obstructive apneas, 1 central apneas, and 2 hypopneas for an overall **AHI of 0.5/hr**. There were 0 RERAs for an **RDI of 0.5/hr.** Average duration of respiratory events were 16.8 seconds. During this time. 7 desaturations occurred during the study. The lowest Sa02 was 94% with an average of 96%. The ODI was 1.1/hr.

**Cardiac Data:**

The average pulse rate during sleep was 53.1 bpm. The highest pulse rate was 96 bpm.

**Arousal Statistics:**

A total of 52 arousals (8.5/hr) were observed during the analysis period as follows, 1 respiratory arousal, 0 leg movement arousals, **50 spontaneous arousals**, and 1 snore arousal.

**PLM Statistics:**

There were 17 PLMS with a PLMS Index of 2.8/hr. 0 PLMS arousals.

**Diagnosis:**

Obstructive Sleep Apnea suspected but not shown to be present.

**Recommendations:**

1. Avoid driving or operating heavy equipment while feeling drowsy.
2. Consider medications and/or CBT to improve sleep consolidation.
3. Maintain adequate sleep hygiene.

Some questions I have,

1. Is there a definition of a ""spontaneous arousal""? Is it just something that isn't related to breathing or restless legs?
2. If I have already been following these recommendations the past 2 years (Tried CBT and have been on basically every sleep med out there (benadryl, trazodone, hydroxyzine, gabapentin, clonazepam, and ambien with zero success)) am I basically just screwed?

SleepApnea,"I'm 28. I was first diagnosed in 2017, but I was told it wasn't bad enough for a CPAP just yet. When I had a sleep study in August 2021, I was told it was severe sleep apnea. I'm always tired. I haven't slept well in a \*long\* time. I am a PhD student and I'll doze off in class. I can't drive long distances because I'll get tired as well. My dad gave me his ResMed AirSense10 CPAP that he never used (the neurologist said this was perfectly fine). I know it's a little bit outdated. 

I first got the machine in December 2021 (I was in Canada for my master's so that's why there was a delay). I have never been able to sleep an entire night. It's a full mask as I am a mouth breather. I feel super claustrophobic. I have never slept a full night all this time. The very few times I had fallen asleep, I had taken off the mask unconsciously in my sleep. I was using an AirFit F20 Large. Looking back, I think it may have been too big as there was leakage (I was fitted and everything though). I also have a beard which has never been great with the full mask.

I got a Medium AirFit F20 this past Christmas and it fits better, but I still haven't been able to fall asleep. At times, I've spent hours just laying there. It could possibly be anxiety as well (re: claustrophobia). I will say I had given up for long periods of month since Dec 2021, but I get so frustrated that I can't sleep with it. I just want to sleep well. This affects my life and as a PhD student being tired all the time (especially when I'm in the Humanities and read a lot) sucks so bad. I live in a new state now so I don't know if seeing a new sleep doctor is the call. I want to keep trying with this but again it just isn't working. Sometimes I give up too easy which I'll admit, but at least I'm trying again.

SleepApnea,"I know sleep apnea can cause silent reflux. 
But would you feel the symptoms of silent reflux DURING the day? Like excess phlegm in the throat? 

I'm asking because my ENT told me I've got a very inflamed throat and the inflammation makes it super narrow. 

I've got sinus issues etc, so I'm wondering if all my symptoms could be caused by silent reflux. And it's the reflux causing the inflammation and subsequently the sleep apnea not the other way around? 

So if your sleep apnea causes reflux, do you experience the symptoms during the day?

SleepApnea,"So I currently am living with my dad who had several sleep apnea. He’s used a cpap since I was a kid and generally hasn’t had many issues with it, until recently that is. I’ve lived with him for the last year and a half now and for the last month or so the whistling noise has gotten worse and more infuriatingly annoying, and that’s with his door shut (I have to leave mine cracked as I have a cat who comes and goes all night). 

I’ve told him and he said the mask and hose he has now are fairly new, which in the past it’s been an issue of just needing to replace them. He uses the over the nose mask and he does have facial hair, but it hasn’t been a problem until now. He doesn’t toss and turn a ton (as far as I’m aware) and he really only sleeps with one pillow. But the whistling is so damn loud, like a tea kettle, and goes on until i basically wake him up so adjust, but then it still happens a short while later. Occasionally I’ll even hear him snoring, as if the mask has slipped off entirely. He claims the straps are tight enough, but nothing resolves the issue for more than a few minutes most nights.

I mean it’s minor and plenty of people are far worse off. I really didn’t think CPAP would make much of a difference, mines minor right.

SleepApnea,"  I have been putting off getting a sleep study for a long time. My fiancé has told me since we started dating almost 11 years ago that I would basically stop breathing in my sleep, but since I have always felt rested after sleeping, I put it off. Now getting closer to our wedding date I decided to act especially since my snoring has just gotten worse over the years. After doing some research I was happy to learn about Lofta through many reddit and forum posts. I immediately contacted Lofta and purchased an at home sleep test. I did the test earlier this week and this morning I was emailed my results. Only to my surprise my sleep apnea is as severe as it gets and I was diagnosed with Complex Sleep Apnea  pAHI =115.3 with apparent Sleep Related Hypoxemia O2 nadir 51%..

Due to this test result Lofta basically washes their hands of prescribing anything and the recommendation is to go to a real sleep doctor. I understand this information is valuable, but I am surprised they don’t outright specify results like mine can occur where I 100% have sleep apnea, but they are unable to do anything for me. I feel like I was misled and felt the need to warn others before you spend your hard-earned money if you decided to go the online home sleep study route. If you feel your sleep apnea is severe enough, DO NOT waste your money and time with online providers and go straight to an in-person sleep doctor.

SleepApnea,"Hi, first time, long time,

I had a quick question I was hoping you could help me with. I can purchase a second hand Resmed Airsense 10 Autoset at half price. The machine has run on 25 hours so its basically brand new. However the serial number begins with 2216 which means it was produced int 2016 right? 

So I was chatting with an CPAP tech (Resmed specialist) and he reckoned that the machines usually last 20,000 hours or 5 years whichever comes soonest. My question is, in your experience is that right? even though this machine has not run, its over 6 years old at this point, better of paying retail and getting a new one? Also it does not come with a humidifier, tube or mask (it has an endcap so it can be used without a humidfier.

SleepApnea,"TL/DR: Have you found that over the counter options like Flonase, etc, decreased snoring? Lifestyle changes?

Recently did a sleep study after my partner complained about consistent snoring, but also said it sounded like I was struggling to take full breaths. Sleep Cycle app was clocking up to two hours or snoring per night. My sleep overall is consistent and I don’t struggle with waking during the night or not feeling refreshed. 

My sleep study diagnosed mild sleep apnea, and obviously I want to make sure I’m respirating properly while sleeping, but I’m curious if a CPAP machine is necessary for mild sleep apnea. I’m very sensitive to touch while sleeping and I feel like I might actually sleep worse with the machine. I’ve also read that CPAP might be overkill for mild sleep apnea. 

I’ve used an over the counter oral device that reduces, if completely eliminates snoring. However, it’s uncomfortable and too big for my mouth, causing abrasions to my gums and mouth, and my teeth hurt if it’s worn correctly all night. My partner can sleep better now, but I’m miserable. 

I’m playing telephone with my doctor, who first recommended CPAP. I asked about whether lifestyle changes would help (I’m changing very soon to a daily schedule that will allow me to better prioritize exercise and movement) and if I could be fitted for an oral device. So far they’ve come back with suggesting the lifestyle changes and breath rite strips (which do not work for me) and Flonase. Hopefully I can have a conversation with my doctor next week….

In the meantime, I need help. I would like to avoid CPAP for the cost/inconvenience, but don’t want to keep sleep depriving my partner.

SleepApnea,"I was told I have mild sleep disordered breathing with and 3 RERAS per hour. Getting conflicting advice on if I need CPAP or not?

I've not had very restful sleep for years now, and daytime sleepiness, so I got a sleep study which showed an RDI of 3 (3 RERAS, nothing else). They noted that I have sleep disordered breathing but not quite enough to qualify for sleep apnea (needs to be &gt;= 5).

SleepApnea,"I apologize if this isn't the correct subreddit but I'm at my wit's end and need some assistance.

I'm 30, M, 5'4"", 180lbs, pre-diabetic (5.7%), located in southern California.

In a nutshell, I am desperately awaiting my sleep study which will take a month for me to even be examined for a polysomnography, which then I would need to see my primary physician to get an authorization for a CPAP if needed, which would possible take even longer. I can go see a sleep specialist out-of-network next week, but at my own expense. With the cost of the consultation ($400), sleep study ($1200-1600), and possible CPAP ($2000-3000), the cost is potentially looking to be \~$5000.

Is there something specific I should be looking for when going to a sleep specialist? Are these charges overpriced?

During the day, I ""forget"" to breathe, and this is especially true when I attempt to sleep. I haven't gotten more than 5 hours of sleep in a long period of time now. I believe I may also have nocturia, because I frequently wake to use the bathroom, but that isn't diagnosed yet. I also might have an enlarged prostate even though my primary doctor says I don't. I don't believe him because the ultrasound report showed that my dimensions are larger than a typical prostate. That, and the symptoms are having to frequently visit the restroom during the day, difficulty emptying, and dribbling, are all a large indication of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.

At this point would it be worth it for me to get my own PPO insurance so that they can cover or even partially cover the cost? I would also be able to choose a better primary doctor as well as other specialists I need to see.

I'm not sure if this is one of those ""choose time vs money"" scenarios or if there's another solution I may not be thinking of.

SleepApnea,"Hey so I (F24) have been waiting since November to get tested for sleep apnea. I originally was given a referral to be tested for it because I stopped breathing during a routine endoscopy and had to be given extra oxygen during it. I have all the symptoms of sleep apnea with fatigue being the worst part. I feel like I’m in hell, no matter how much sleep I get, I’m exhausted. I can barely get out of bed and it has taken a huge toll on my mental health. I’m seriously ready to die I’m so fatigued and miserable. 

To make matters worse, I currently live with my parents who are abusive. I have absolutely no money so I can’t move out unless I want to be homeless. I’m very worried that if I have to pay out of pocket for a sleep apnea test or machine, they won’t help me. I could definitely see them saying no to a CPAP machine, even if it could save my life. My parents do not care about me at all, I have shown them articles about the effects of untreated sleep apnea, they just said it’s too bad for me. My dad even said he hopes I do die from sleep apnea.
There is also no other friends or family in my life who can help me. 

I’m wondering if there are ANY charities that could help me get tested for sleep apnea and get a machine?

SleepApnea,"Hey guys! First time poster - and I know that everyone is unique and have also already been diagnosed and had a CPAP ordered, so I’m not looking for medical advice.

I’m curious whether anyone has been diagnosed with mild apnea (AHI of 9.0) with a moderate REM component? In supine REM sleep, my AHI went up to 18.5 - the first doctor I saw told me that my results were “very mild” and might as well not be treated at all. The second doctor (at the same office) said that these were very significant findings and I would likely benefit substantially from starting CPAP therapy. 

Part of me is excited and hopeful that CPAP will help get my life back a bit and cut down on the plethora of symptoms I’ve been having, but I also know that the first doctor said it was basically a worthless finding with very little clinical significance. Anyone else in the same boat? Is the doctor who dismissed these findings crazy? And are my numbers high enough that I can potential see a lot of benefit?

- Getting used to it took time. I wasn’t able to spend time wearing it while awake before bed so getting to sleep was a challenge at first
- The ‘fit’ was way different in bed laying down than what I worked out with the tech who helped fit. Pulling the straps right actually caused air leaks.
- I woke more frequently last night, mostly for restroom breaks but I think it was because I was nervous about unhooking and such. That wasn’t a big deal at all.

SleepApnea,"I’ve had issues with sleep since I was a kid - sleep paralysis/night terrors, frequent waking up, trouble falling asleep, insomnia, etc. (Seriously, my mother often says I stopped napping at a super early age.) I assume it’s just par for the course, as I’m also an autistic ADHDer. And I have occasional flare ups of restless leg syndrome, plus Ehlers-Danlos type iii.

The first thing every doctor suggests is maybe I have sleep apnea, because when I do seem to sleep all night, I still feel like crap the next day. (I have never in my life wakes up feeling “refreshed.”) But I don’t snore or gasp, and I’ve used a pulse oximeter several nights to see what my blood oxygen is, and it’s always been fine.

So could it still be apnea? I ordered a Lofta test to finally find out—mostly because I’m afraid to do the full sleep study overnight somewhere (I cannot sleep at all if I’m in a strange place).

SleepApnea,"Hi. I am posting this on Reddit because I know there are many people smarter than me on here. This might be a wordy post. I’m 32(M) 181 lbs. I’ve had bruxism for quite a few years but never did much about it. In October of 2021 I started to experience a really dry mouth in the morning. And then around the spring of 2022 I started to get really bad brain fog/lack of concentration.

I’ve had normal blood work done, and testosterone checked and everything came back great. About 6 weeks ago I had a sleep study, and got the results back. The sleep doctor told me I do have sleep apnea with a “sleep score of 5”. She made it sound like I should try weight loss and not sleeping on my back. I have great health insurance and money in the bank so I told her to proceed with a CPAP, which is in the works. She was supposed to mail the sleep results 3 weeks ago but I don’t have them yet. 

I’m on pantoprazole for LPR for about 12 weeks and also on Welbutrin for about 2 weeks. The sleep study was difficult to do and I only got about 5 hours or so of sleep. I don’t drink or smoke, but I do have a shaky diet. I’m not sure if the CPAP will be much help as my sleep score was low/borderline. I’ve never been able to run very long without stopping, so I wonder if it is an endurance/breathing issue. I’ve also noticed when I go outside recently that the fresh air feels incredibly amazing. So I wonder if it’s an oxygen issue.

SleepApnea,"I posted this yesterday but I didn't get many replies, so I decided to repost earlier. I hope that isn't frowned upon. 

A year ago I had a study confirming I have sleep apnea. I decided instead of a titration study to buy a Resmed Autoset 10 and do it myself. After a year, I gave up after not seeing any results, even with help from online, and decided to schedule an appointment. By results I mean I wanted to feel fully rested and feel normal. 
My titration study results say my prescription should be 8cm CPAP, but I feel like it's not making much of a difference, especially with my AHI being around 3-4. I know it hasn't been long since I've been on 8cm, but I've been using APAP for over a year (with different pressures all over the place) so I'm definitely used to sleeping with it. 
I also don't feel like I slept enough at my sleep study, it was very difficult. I did sleep enough according to the nurse, but I'm still not sure. And I wake up a lot during the night too and I move around too much. I don't wake up coughing or choking or needing the restroom
 I just open my eyes, change position and fall back asleep. 
And lastly, my AHI for the first few hours is usually pretty low but after that it increases. That's been happening with the different pressures I've used throughout the year.
I do have OSCAR in case that's needed, but I only have a few days of being on 8cm and I'm not good at reading the charts.
Would it be better to switch to APAP instead, something close to my prescription? Or maybe I should ask my primary doctor for some sleep medication so I won't wake up throughout the night?

SleepApnea,"Hey All,

33/M here. 6'2"" 400+ lbs.

I just have some concerns I would like air out to the community here to see what you all think.

I KNOW I have sleep apnea. It's gotten better since I got on blood pressure medication and basically quit drinking (I maybe drink once a month now). I also try to avoid eating greasy/fatty food late at night because that seems to make my sleep apnea worse.

ANYWAY.

I just got an at-home sleep study on its way to me through my insurance. I did an at home sleep study like two years ago, but then my GP still wanted me to do an in-lab study, which wasn't covered by my insurance at the time and I did not have $1 to $2K lying around so I let it go.

I have since switched jobs and the new job has slightly better insurance. The in-lab sleep study still isn't covered, but the at-home one is.

Long windedly, what I am trying to say is, I am worried that on the night I do the at-home test, I somehow stumble into a ""good"" night's sleep where I don't have a ton of non-breathing events and then they look at that and say ""nah we won't prescribe you a CPAP machine."" And I am just screwed.

In addition to my doctor seeing my first at-home test 2 years ago and basically admitting then that I have it; I also, for the last four years, have been dealing with ALL of the symptoms I see all of you complain about on here (i.e. brain fog, tiredness, never feeling rested, dry mouth/lips, sore throat, headache in the morning, feeling like all I am able to do is go to work and when I come home I just crash and don't have energy to exercise, etc.)

I cannot keep living this way. I know I need to lose weight, but I have no energy or executive functioning to workout before or after work.

Is this just my anxiety worrying that the test won't be enough to get me my CPAP prescription? Or is this a legit concern?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*PLEASE no ""just lose weight"" posts. It is ridiculously difficult to get medical professionals to take you seriously when you're overweight. I know I need to lose weight, but I need restful sleep/the energy resulting from that restful sleep in order to be able to do that\*\*

However, after the first adjustment, it seems to be somehow pulling my jaw to the side rather than forward. One of the metal bars on the side feels like it’s looser and has more give than the other.

Has anyone experienced this? It feels weird and is making me really anxious about going to sleep. I’m trying to get a hold of the sleep dentist to prescribe that, but he’s hard to get ahold of; I also wanted to see if anyone else had experienced this.

SleepApnea,"24M, 5'10 160lbs healthy and active. Been having sleep problems for roughly 2 years now, and the sleepiness/fatigue is debilitating enough that I haven't been able to start working after college. It's honestly really hard to keep going at this point, I just want my life back the way it was.

Here's a previous post I made that goes over most of the things I've done so far (Sleep meds, fixing my deviated septum, testing my thryoid, etc):

[**https://www.reddit.com/r/BedBros/comments/zf8d5j/any\_thoughts\_on\_what\_else\_could\_possibly\_be\_the/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BedBros/comments/zf8d5j/any_thoughts_on_what_else_could_possibly_be_the/)

I have no problem falling asleep, but I wake up usually with a mix of upper back/jaw tightness, and sometimes acid reflux. Whenever I do wake up though (usually after 5-6 hours) its typically physically impossible for me to fall back asleep. I'll lay there in bed with my eyes closed, mind empty, feeling exhausted, but cannot fall back asleep**. The best way I can describe it is that ""my mind is able to fall asleep but my body wont let me"".** *(Note: This started out of nowhere, sometime in early 2021, before then I could sleep 8-9 hours no problem)*

**I'm still waiting on the official report for my sleep study but I did get the raw data and technician comments already**, but unfortunately it seems like this was once again another waste of time and money. Basically the summary seemed to be:

**EEG/Sleep Architecture:**

\-Prolonged Sleep Latency, Prolonged REM latency, All stages of sleep achieved.

\-Majority of arousals caused by spontaneous arousals.

**Respiratory:**

\-During diagnostic, patient displayed rare, minor hypopneas.

\-Rare, minor centrals seen during REM. Rare, minor flow limitation observed during REM.

\-At 2AM, patient had an AHI of 0.2/hr

\-Spo2 nadir: 91%

**Limb Movements:**

\-No significant limb movements seen.

**EKG Revealed:**

\-Normal Sinus Rhythm

\-Average Heart Rate during sleep: 52.8bpm

Now maybe the official report will provide extra insight, but as of right now it kinda feels like I paid $3000 for someone to explain what I already know...that my sleep is shit and I don't know why.

**The only thing I'm still trying to pursue is that perhaps my ferritin levels could be the cause of my sleep problems. My ferritin was 40 in December (normal range 38-350 according to Quest), 34 in early January, and I plan on getting tested again next week.** I had most of my other vitamin levels check (D, B12, Folate) and everything else was normal. Thyroid normal, the other million things I got test normal. Ferritin is the only thing that sticks out and apparently it can cause sleep issues for people if its under 50-75, so we shall see.

Any thoughts? I know that this isn't 100% SA related, but I'm so desperate to find some type of answer to get relief.

SleepApnea,"Hi, so I started using a CPAP yesterday.

SleepApnea,"A year ago I had a study confirming I have sleep apnea. I decided instead of a titration study to buy a Resmed Autoset 10 and do it myself. After a year, I gave up after not seeing any results, even with help from online, and decided to schedule an appointment. By results I mean I wanted to feel fully rested and feel normal. 
My titration study results say my prescription should be 8cm CPAP, but I feel like it's not making much of a difference, especially with my AHI being around 3-4. I know it hasn't been long since I've been on 8cm, but I've been using APAP for over a year (with different pressures all over the place) so I'm definitely used to sleeping with it. 
I also don't feel like I slept enough at my sleep study, it was very difficult. I did sleep enough according to the nurse, but I'm still not sure. And I wake up a lot during the night too and I move around too much. I don't wake up coughing or choking or needing the restroom
 I just open my eyes, change position and fall back asleep. 
And lastly, my AHI for the first few hours is usually pretty low but after that it increases. That's been happening with the different pressures I've used throughout the year.
I do have OSCAR in case that's needed, but I only have a few days of being on 8cm and I'm not good at reading the charts.
Would it be better to switch to APAP instead, something close to my prescription? Or maybe I should ask my primary doctor for some sleep medication so I won't wake up throughout the night?

SleepApnea,"I was getting better quality sleep with CPAP, but still had a lot of trouble with any regularity; which wrecks havoc on our circadian rhythm.

Anybody that listens to the Huberman podcast knows about how light hitting our retinas at different times of day works to set our internal clocks.

These alarms do a wind down routine that helps you relax and get ready to go to sleep, you can simulate a sunset with them. Then in the morning they light up and progressively get brighter simulating a sunrise. The light hits your eyelids and to my understanding begins the process of removing melatonin and other sleep hormones/neurotransmitters/etc from the system. Then you can set the duration of how long the light takes to ramp up and when the relaxing wake up sound turns on. 

I tried three different ones:

Ultimately I landed on the Philips. The improvement to my life is well worth the investment for the best product.

SleepApnea,"Snoring for many is a year long concern and worry. However, it is often the case that snoring will increase over winter and those that don’t often snore can often find themselves snoring. Winter snoring and sleeping problems are nothing new but understanding why they occur and what you can do about it can help put you at ease and reduce your issues going forward.

**Why is snoring more common in winter?**

There are a few reasons why you may find yourself snoring more during the winter months. The first reason is that the air is generally drier during winter, which can lead to congestion in the nose and throat. This congestion can block the airway and cause snoring.Another reason is that people tend to spend more time indoors during winter, which can lead to less ventilation and more dust in the air. This can again lead to congestion and snoring. Finally, winter clothes are generally heavier and bulkier than summer clothes, which can put pressure on the chest and throat and contribute to snoring as well as blankets and heavy-duty quilts. So if you find yourself snoring more during the winter, it may be due to a combination of factors. Congestion from dry air, dust in the air, and pressure on the chest and throat can all contribute to snoring.

**How to treat seasonal snoring** 

The good news is that seasonal snoring is often easier to treat and it shouldn’t take too much to alleviate or, at the very least, reduce your symptoms. However, you may not be aware of some of the easier ways to reduce snoring if you don’t experience snoring all that often.

**Utilise a humidifier** 

Inflamed nasal passages can result from breathing in extremely dry air, which can also dry out your nasal passages. Dry air can therefore cause snoring. Using a humidifier can help you sleep well if your home is dry (especially during the months when you can't open the windows because of the heat or cold).

**Decongest**

Decongesting before bedtime is another strategy to stop snoring at night. To open up your nasal passages, you can use a Neti pot, take a hot shower, or apply a nasal decongestant.

**Maintain Your Head Upright**

You might discover that resting flat on your back makes your congestion worse if you're already feeling congested. Try sleeping with your head elevated to reduce snoring during sleep.

If you’ve tried all of the tips listed above and they haven’t helped, there might be something more serious at play.",t2_dr0xvm33,0,Winter snoring?

SleepApnea,"As I’m falling asleep I feel a weird sensation that makes me gasp for air. This usually happens a few times a night, when bad it can be over 10 times. It really makes sleeping a chore sometimes. I think for me they are caused by anxiety.

I took a sleep test last summer and I had mild to moderate sleep apnea based on what position I slept I in. I do not have a CPAP due to cost and insurance issues. If the apnea has gotten worse, could that have raised my WBC? Does anyone have experience with that?

SleepApnea,"I was recently diagnosed with sleep apnea following an in lab sleep study. It was likely one of the worst nights of sleep I’ve ever had. Part way through the night, the lab tech told me they needed to put me on a CPAP (which I’ve never used before). I had trouble adjusting to the machine and after awhile the tech asked me if I wanted to remove the mask. I said yes, as I was having trouble breathing/falling asleep with it on.

Fast forward to my follow up appt with the doc, and she’s now telling me I need to do another in lab sleep study because they weren’t able to record enough data for her to prescribe a pressure level. This is highly frustrating for multiple reasons.

1. The tech never mentioned they needed more data when she asked if I wanted to remove the mask. If she would have, I wouldn’t have said yes to removing it.

2. It costs me $500 every time I do a sleep study.

3. My wife is pregnant and the due date is the end of March. This is also apparently the only time they can schedule the second study. 

When I asked if there were any other options, the doc reluctantly mentioned I could use an APAP machine. She didn’t seem to be a fan of this, and was pushing for CPAP, which would require the second study. 

My question is, why would she be hesitant to recommend APAP? And is there any reason why I couldn’t order a machine (such as the AirSense 11) which would allow me to start on APAP, and potentially switch to CPAP after collecting some initial use data?

For what’s it’s worth, I’m not a fan of the doc. Unfortunately she’s the only available in my health network. When scheduling my initial sleep study, she said she would allow me to do the at home test, but if results came back negative she would still want to schedule an in lab test. That didn’t make sense to me, but I opted to go ahead and do the in lab instead of at home. Now she’s pushing for the second in lab test.

SleepApnea,"Have had SA diagnosed for nearly 10 years and uses a Resmed S9 diligently every night all night. Doing pretty well.

Local DME is trash, I own my machine and buy my own supplies. Did an at home sleep study initially to set pressures. PCP recommended I do a new study last year, but local DME is once again, crap and would rather not work with them.

I'd like to take a step back and assess the situation better before doing anything more but not sure what kind of specialist I should ask for a referral to.

ENTs seem to focus on jaw surgery. Dental specialists like to prescribe dental appliances. My local PCP hands out prescriptions for CPAP.

Is there a practitioner that is qualified in all treatments that will objectively tell me what's best for my situation and not just tell me I need the type of treatment they provide?

SleepApnea,"I have about 20 white matter hyperintensities in my brain. My first mri showing this was at 26yrs old after dealing with some symptoms. I’m 33 now and my most recent mri showed the same lesions with slight progression of those same lesions. 

I have a history of high blood pressure since 13 but was supposedly controlled with medications. I’ll be honest, i did not monitor my blood pressure that closely.

In my 20’s started going out and drinking and all that stuff you do when you’re young. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea at 30 though I’m fairly certain I had it since I was 20ish as I had similar symptoms in the past just not as severe.

I took an at home test at 26 that stated I had no sleep apnea but I’m certain it was a failed test as I was dealing with fatigue and sleepiness daily after waking up. I also worked out 5 days a week intensely at the gym with my heart pumping and chest hurting but always pushed myself. Went to multiple docs before regarding this issue but no help so just dealt with it.

My brain lesions on the mri are suspected lesions from white matter disease due to hypertension but I know sleep apnea causes lesions too. When my apnea was at my worst my O2 levels would drop to 70ish at night. My lab test suggested I had mild to moderate sleep apnea. 

I’m wondering is there a way to tell the type of lesions apart? Whether they are from blood pressure or sleep apnea? Reason I’m asking is because I was hoping to reverse some or most of it. And I know sleep apnea white matter damage has the potential to be reversed. Whereas white matter damage from hypertension does not have the same reversability. I’m dealing with so much and need help and I’ve seen 4 neuros and spent over 70k out of pocket on my health. 

The following is from my mri:

“1. THERE IS MILD TO MODERATE WHITE MATTER DISEASE WHICH HAS
SLIGHTLY PROGRESSED COMPARED WITH PRIOR STUDY. THIS APPEARANCE
IS NONSPECIFIC AND MAY BE SEEN WITH CHRONIC SMALL VESSEL
ISCHEMIC DISEASE HOWEVER THE PATIENT IS YOUNG AND OTHER

2. ORBITS DEMONSTRATE NO ACUTE ABNORMALITY. THERE IS MILD

3: CHRONIC RIGHT MAXILLARY SINUSITIS, LESS PROMINENT THAN ON

SleepApnea,"So I’ve been dealing with god awful fatigue for about 7-8 months now. It’s so bad that sometimes I just feel like I can’t go on. On my worst days I wake up and feel like I’ve been hit by a truck. 

I got a sleep study done last month which came back showing mild sleep apnea (ahi 8-10, that’s all I know.). I haven’t been able to get a cpap yet because my phone number is disconnected at the moment but I’m getting a new plan soon so I can get this sorted out.
 
Anyways, my fatigue has been absolutely debilitating. I manage to keep my part time job but that’s about all the energy I have. I can’t go out with friends anymore, I can’t plan for the future. I don’t even know how I get through work, probably because I have no other option. 

I can’t eat all day because if I do my brain fog and sleepiness gets too bad for me to function. I can’t do anything physically strenuous because the same exact thing happens. My only hope is cpap because everything else checks out. If that doesn’t work then my doc says I’m basically SOL.

SleepApnea,"Hello everyone!  Been lurking in here for a couple of weeks and finally decided to contribute to this sub.  I got diagnosed about 2 months ago with a mild case of sleep apnea at an AHI of 6.8.  For years I experienced waking up in the morning with dry mouth and excruciating headaches but I could never pinpoint what was wrong with me.  It wasn't until about 8 months ago that I stumbled upon a gym influencers PSA YouTube video about sleep apnea that finally gave me an inkling that I might be suffering from it.  Everything came to a head about 5 months ago when I started experiencing heart palpitations, extreme anxiety and digestive issues such as constipation (which normally isnt considered a sleep apnea symptom.)  That's when I finally decided to do something about it and visit my local sleep doctor to get myself checked out.  I was given a home test kit and I had one of the worst nights of sleep in my life using it, only getting about 4-5 hrs of sleep.

Which brings me to the last week and a half.  I'm going through a bit of a financial pinch so I really couldn't shell out money for a CPAP machine.  ""Luckily"" for me, my brother and his wife also suffer from sleep apnea and happened to have an extra machine they weren't using, all with a brand new tube and mask still in packaging.  I started using it with my doctors prescribed pressure settings of 4-10 on January 12th.  My follow up appointment on the 19th showed that I cut my AHI in half from my aforementioned 6.8 to a now manageable 2.7.  I sometimes feel tired throughout the day but not severely as I used to.  Same with the heart palpitations.  My digestive issues are also much better.  Although I attribute my improved digestion more to the supplements I've been taking as opposed to CPAP therapy, I still believe it has had a significant impact on it.

Am I feeling 100%?  Not yet.  However I do feel like I have the ball rolling in the right direction.  It may take me several weeks or several months to get there but I'm positive that I will get there.

SleepApnea,"Hello guys. I thought I’d post here to get some opinions and vent a little.

Several months ago I attempted a at home sleep study but took off the equipment midnight around 1-2am. 
I just couldn’t fall asleep what made it worst was I couldn’t fall asleep on my back that night.

The problem I’m having is I can’t seem to fall asleep on my back and haven’t in over a year. I try to I’ll relax my neck and chin sinks down then when I exhale it’s like I’m snoring, feels like my throat closes up a bit. I am overweight, which I suspect is the main reason why. 

I’m gonna setup a appointment with my Doc next week to see the sleep specialist again. Things are getting pretty miserable having shitty sleep and waking up to a tight neck/traps everyday.

SleepApnea,"Hello you guys!

I struggle with going to a GP for several reasons, so I'm mainly making this post to hold myself accountable as I'd like to get myself checked out once the weekend is over, but I'd also like to share my situation in case anyone relates and I'd like to hear thoughts on if I'm right on going to my GP.

For a while now I've been having regular dreams, but I always feel out of breath during them as if I'm gasping for air. It doesn't feel nice.

During our last holiday, I had to sleep on the couch and so my family saw me sleeping if they were awake early. Apparently it looked like I was choking in my sleep and it looked quite scary.

I've gained quite a lot of weight recently and am definitely overweight, and while I didn't snore before I definitely do now. I also wake up with my throat feeling completely dry every day.

I don't ever recall waking up during the night though, and I don't necessarily feel exhausted during the day but I'm almost always able to fall asleep right away when I try.

Going to the doctor's is quite a challenge for me, and it's something I'm in therapy for, but I WANT to get myself checked so I will update with how it went if (when lol) I succeed. :)",t2_gwadoqz,0,Holding myself accountable + my situation at the moment,[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,10idtrb,True,FoxNix,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/10idtrb/holding_myself_accountable_my_situation_at_the/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/10idtrb/holding_myself_accountable_my_situation_at_the/,34797,1674372003,0,,False,1674372016,1674491947,2023-01-22 07:20:03,,,,,,,

SleepApnea,"Hello All,

Just completed my first sleep study.  While I expected a diagnosis of OSA due to issues with snoring, it turns out my test showed not only extreme OSA, but mild CSA as well and I was prescribed a bipap as a result.

I was expecting a CPAP and knew I would probably spend a while dialing in pressure until I found what I need, but I'm kind of not understanding how all this works with a bipap instead.

Is my current RX just the full range of the machine and it'll automatically dial in when the correct pressure is, or is my breathing so bad that I am really looking at having the machine set to max pressure on inhalation?

So I know this topic has been talked about to death but I am seeing conflicting information on this. Or I am just not understanding...  


I sleep in a cold room, a room that's even colder in the winter. I've started experiencing rainout in my mask. Specifically the mask and mask tubing, not the climate line tube.

Some literature I've read states to raise the tube temp so that the air I am exhaling into the mask is closer to the temperature of the air coming into the mask. Other literature I've read says to lower the tube temp so that the temperature difference between the air inside the mask is closer to the ambient room temperature.

SleepApnea,"Device: ResMed Airsense 11  


Apologies in advanced for the novel. Okay, so a couple months back I decided to attempt CPAP once again. I've been using a mandibular advancement device for several years now. Throughout that time, my bite changed, and I was experiencing jaw discomfort. Well, I think my body said ""enough is enough"" and I talked with my doctor about attempting CPAP again (my first experience wasn't great).  


Since early November of 2022, I've been on CPAP and so far it has gone better than my previous experiences I was put on nasal pillows and found it easier to use than a full face mask. But soon thereafter I noticed that I was waking up burping a lot and would have stomach pains and dry mouth. Well, turns out that my jaw slacks open when I sleep and so the air comes out. My sleep doctor recommended a chip strap (Philips Respironics brand). This gave me pause because I was concerned that my jaw might have issues with that. It's a band that straps to the top of the head and cups under the chin. It feels like it pulls upwards and not backwards, but still. (I know people here have recommended the knightsbridge chin strap and I'm currently thinking about trying it.)

&amp;#x200B;

I used the chin strap for a while and found a happy medium place with it. I wouldn't wake up burping several times a night and my mouth was relatively okay in the morning regarding dryness. But overtime I started noticing some light numbness on the left side of my jaw. Keep in mind, this is the side that was really hurting when I was using a MAD device to treat sleep apnea. However, I didn't think too much of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time after, one thing I noticed is that I would grind my teeth more because of the jaw strap. Talked to my sleep dentist (who was treating me with the MAD) and she recommended a night guard to help with that. Seemed logical, so I went ahead and had one made. While that was being made I was trying to get away from using the chin strap because I kind of felt like the chin strap was still... bothersome. I looked around for advice on Reddit and found that people recommended something like the ResMed F30i. I got that ordered and tried it out but still had several issues. My jaw would still slack open and I experienced even more dry mouth than before. So I thought, maybe I can use the chin strap with this. And it helped, but it felt silly that I'm using it as I was hoping the F30i would mean I don't need to use the chin strap. My sleep doctor (not the dentist) agreed and said I could just go back to the nasal pillows at that point since it seemed to help somewhat.  


By this time my night guard came in and I was starting to use it with the full face mask. This went on for a couple of weeks. And I started to notice that that numbness was getting stronger. After those two weeks, I went back to the nasal pillows I had with the chin strap and now a night guard. And within a couple of days, I woke up noticing numbness was very present. As if I had gotten a shot of Novocain. I could feel it even in my lips. I talked to my sleep dentist and mentioned that I think I was only biting on the left side of my jaw with the device (the side that was now super numb). I went in that day, she adjusted it so I was biting evenly on the night guard. But I mentioned the jaw numbness and she said that, given my history of complications with the MAD device, maybe we should take a break from the night guard.  


Well, that was yesterday. Last night I slept without the night guard and without the jaw strap. Still using the CPAP (APAP) machine and only using the nasal pillows. But, as expected, I was very burpy and my mouth was very dry. I bought a ton of micropore tape because early on I read that maybe I can try mouth tape. Unfortunately it wasn't very effective also because I have a full beard and mustache.  


So I think that's why I'm writing this. I'm looking to brain storm ideas of other ways I can use CPAP/APAP therapy, without a full face mask, without a chin strap. Maybe I need to keep experimenting with the tape? I'm... really not wanting to shave, but maybe I have to for my health? I was thinking, maybe there was like a device I could have in my mouth that sits between my teeth and lips that would create a seal. Almost like when you were a kid and stuck a slice of orange in your mouth and smiled with the peel.

I am currently working on a university project centred around raising sleep apnea awareness. I have recently been diagnosed, and am now discovering just how big of an issue this is. But also how undiscussed it is outside of forums like these. 

I want to ask about your experiences, how did you learn about it? How old were you when you learned about it/got diagnosed? What symptoms did you show that made you inclined to check on it? Have you even heard about it before you were diagnosed?

This info would be very helpful in setting a direction for this project and I would appreciate any response given.

SleepApnea,"FIRST QUESTION.

I have trouble sleeping with **heavy fogginess** the next day.... 

About a month ago, I found out I am dealing with Acid Reflux.  

And then last week I did a sleep study and found out I have pretty bad Sleep Apnea as well.

I am hoping the Acid Reflux is causing the Apnea, because the reflux is solvable.

But the doctor said that was impossible.

He said maybe acid reflux makes the apnea worse.  But he said it can't be the sole cause.

So, first question is....is that true?

&amp;#x200B;

SECOND QUESTION

Every now and then,  I wake up and my energy is good the next day.   No fogginess at all.  And this goes on for about a week.

So, if I have sleep apnea would I have it **every night.**  Or can it **come and go** for a week or so?

Because if apnea usually shows up **every night**, then maybe what I have isn't just obstruction based apnea.   Maybe it's brought on by acid reflux.

Do you have any thoughts or insights or stories that cold help inform or guide me?

SleepApnea,"
I’m a public figure. I have this big red mark on the top of my nose and get a ton of strange looks of people. I’ve tried 3 different masks. The n20 is the one mask I can sleep with. I’ve also tried nasal pillows and another nasal mask. Both the alternatives wrecked my sleep. I’ve also briefly tried a whole facemask and struggle with it. Here’s everything I’ve tried:

1) lanolin alone on my nose.
2) lanolin with a bandaid.
3) bandaid alone.
4) pad a cheek liner.
5) gel nose bridge pad.
6) airfit n20 nasal cushion with foam.
7) several different permutations mixing all of these combinations.

Here’s the issue. All of the cushioning options require my mask straps to be really tight to prevent air leaks. Even then, I find air leaks to be much more common when I use these preventative measures and I end up sleeping poorer. At that, I’ve never had any of these cushioning options decrease the redness on my nose.

So I’m at a loss for what to do. Any recommendations? Any other nasal masks I should try? Anyone have any silver bullet solutions?",t2_f88tzhaw,0,Really struggling with red marks on my nose.

SleepApnea,"Hi folks,  
My doc referred me to a pulmonologist in December, but the earliest appointment I could get was in March. I'm absolutely miserable and my colleague at work was kind enough to offer me their CPAP, since they no longer need it. It's the Philips DreamStation, which I know has been recalled. This would be a temporary fix while I wait for my study/diagnosis, so I think it's probably OK...  
  
I just wanted to ask:  
1. Is there is any risk in using a CPAP without diagnosis?  
2. I'm assuming the machine is pre-set to the original owner's needs--but will it adapt to me? I was reading the device's manual and there's a whole Provider menu that sets up the pressure and stuff, and I don't think I'll have access to that. Can I make changes to the pressure myself or no?  

If anyone uses/has used the old DreamStation and has any tips for me, I'm all ears! I'm pretty new to the whole sleep apnea thing and very new to the idea of using a CPAP.

SleepApnea,"Has anyone ever looked into exercises regarding the throat, jaw, tongue, etc in order to combat the above? 

I went ahead and took a home test, was told that I am at the border of where mild meets moderate regarding my results (17 events per hr). Went ahead and bought a cpap  device but didn't like it. In all fairness, I didn't give it a reasonable go. Wearing it just made me unable to actually fall asleep when I'd go to bed my normal hour. It also reminded me of my dad in hospice, which was cancer related, where he had a machine helping him breathe until the end.

My other honest problem is this, the medical field should not be providing options that are essentially just band-aids for problems. I always feel like many health issues can be combated naturally too, not with meds, surgery or appliances. 

Anyway, I was reading about breathing exercises and such for snoring / sleep apnea trouble. Also trying to incorporate a hot shower right before bed to ""open up"" for more efficient breathing while sleeping.

Just curious of anyone else's thoughts on the subject. If these types of ideas work, I'd rather be diligent about doing that the rest of my life over a machine strapped to me.

SleepApnea,"I was diagnosed in 2017 with an AHI of 167. When I learned I would probably die in my sleep soon, I took to CPAP like a fish to water. I've used it consistently every night for at least 7 hrs.

I lost a ton of weight, all my health issues caused by OSA resolved, and my drs considered me a star patient (so they've said).

I recently switched drs bc the last one kept pestering me to get the Covid vax even though I have a med  exemption. He also dismissed my need for a new CPAP machine even though it sometimes stops and even though its been over 5 yrs and my insurance pays for a new one every 5 yrs.

This new dr is fantastic! He referred to my compliance as ""phenomenal "", and said that bc I went above and beyond in compliance, he's going to go above and beyond to get me a new machine ASAP.

He wasn't lying! The next morning the med equipment co called to say they're shipping me a brand new Resmed 11! Apparently the shortage is easing up and in 10 mos I will own it. 

Compliance pays off, healthwise and CPAP-wise!

SleepApnea,"Hey guys

I have been using the Resmed Airsense 10 for about 4 years now and recently noticed some loud whirring noises coming from the middle of the system.  I have replaced the filter and changed all the parts but the noise still persists.  I have linked a few videos that show the problem

Basically what is going on is going to bed the mask area is quiet but when I wake up in the morning it seems like the elbow is busted as it makes a whistling noise like air is escaping near the connector.  I would take it off and out it back on again but the air persists no matter what.  It used to be silent the whole time outside of my own breathing but lately it seems like multiple elbows are failing after swapping parts around.

It’s not nausea, burning feeling, or even painful in any way. It’s just a really gross feeling.

SleepApnea,"I’ve (m,48) been trying to be tested for over 4 years and finally got an at-home test. Results to be sent to PCP. I’m Canadian without extra insurance and medical won’t help pay for anything unless it’s ‘severe’ . 

Anyway, I’m kinda hoping once I get treatment it might help with my issues. I have:
Fibromyalgia symptoms (can’t get a doctor to assess this, but I don’t seem to fit the bill for a rheumatic disorder or autoimmune disorder, according to rheumatologist) 

Polyneuropathy fingers, toes-take Gabapentin

Fatigue

Mixed ADHD, anxiety, mild bipolar 2, OCD. Depression. I take Ritalin as little as possible and try to be habit-based. No other meds.
I struggle. Can’t take SSRIs. When I ever get a good sleep, I feel better, mostly. I use weed 2 nights a week and seem to sleep a little better on it. 

Undiagnosed restless legs (Gabapentin seems to help) Also have bulging varicose veins in legs. 

Tinnitus in my right ear mostly. 3x as bad as left ear, anyway. Have been slowly losing my perfect hearing. I am (was) a musician. My hands hurt and I don’t play much anymore.

Nonexistent sex drive and rarely get a good boner. I still feel like I would like to play with it once in a while..

Have good sleep hygiene practice but generally feel like crap in morning especially. Lucky to get 5 hrs a night and rarely feel like I had a good sleep. 

I’m just trying to have a little hope here. I’ll find the money for a machine. I’ll lose those last 35 lbs. I’ll do whatever it takes to try to have a solution. 

Can anyone commiserate? Can I look forward to some problems being mitigated? After all that’s been steadily getting worse with my health, I’m at my wits end. Canada’s medical system isn’t going to do much for me unless I end up in emerge in the back of an ambulance. I couldn’t even get a doctor to order a sleep test. They just keep saying it’s my mental health. Yes, I know I have mental health problems. I do everything I can to mitigate this. I’m mostly stable for long periods of time.

They also said I have to go in and meet with the doctor first before he can schedule the sleep study, which they said could be weeks after my visit.  So now we're into June/July.  I asked if they could do something remote and they said they can't.  I called another doctors office that someone recommended to me and they said they can see me end of April.

SleepApnea,"So after a rough start I finally had a good night's sleep and I wanted to share. 

My sleep test showed 39 events per hour, mainly central. Stopped driving, got a Airsense 11 and a nose mask and started sleeping with the prescribed 7cmH²O. 

The thing is that I felt worse than before. My health care person guided me through different settings and masks, but nothing seemed to help. 

Finally I had to take a break. Two weeks later I was assigned a different health care professional, tried some more settings (EPR or lower pressure during exhalation was a huge improvement for me) including APAP with minimum of 4 and max 8 cmH²O. 

The last option resulted in me waking up feeling fucked (pardon my French) with an AHI of 50... So finally we put 2 and 2 together and theorised that the higher pressure was inducing events...

Last night I tried constant pressure, as low as it would go (4) and slept like a baby. Sure I woke up a number of times, but without any feeling of suffocation or shortness of breath. And this morning I feel... OK. A bit weird, giddy almost, but like a weight has lifted off my shoulders.

One good night is just a start, but I finally see light at the end of the tunnel. And all it took was two month of struggle, three different masks and dozens of different permutations of settings!

I came very close to giving up. Now I am so glad that I hung in there. Thanks to everyone sharing their successes and struggles, you inspired me.

SleepApnea,"So I've had a CPAP for a little over two years, and over that time my usage of it has been pretty inconsistent. Sometimes I'll use it pretty consistently for a month, but have also gone weeks at a time without using it. As far as how well rested I feel, my mental acuity, or my energy levels, there is no difference that I can tell between the periods when I'm using it regularly and when I'm not. I seldom if ever have episodes of waking up gasping for breath.

The numbers in DreamMapper corroborate this story. It's very rare that my AHI is above 5 (all-time high is 6.5), and the majority of the time it's below 2.5. If it matters, the AHI breakdown is more than 80% hyoponeas, less than 20% clear airway or obstructive apneas. Pressure - (min/max of 5/20) the 90% pressure is seldom above 7.5, and I only found a single instance in the distant past when it was above 11.

SleepApnea,"I did Lofta and as expected results weren’t good with AHI at 96 and lowest oxygen level too low. Purchased an AirCurve 10 VAuto and ClimateLine Air. With it I ordered the AirTouch F20 full face mask - Lofta said since I was a mouth breather and with BiPAP they recommended full face. 

I ordered a large and when I got it I could not get a good fit. It seemed too large. So I ordered the same mask in medium. 

I am new to this so may not understand all the terms but my prescription says max IPAP 25, min EPAP 6, PS 4 cm H2O. 

I have ramp up on and the machine starts at 4  with high of 8. Through a first few nights it takes time to fall asleep. I’m used to moving a lot and so adjusting to sleep positions. The mask seems to seal well and feels comfortable. 

However, each of the first 3 nights I wake after a few hours and there are leaks everywhere. The pressure is up to 20 and it wants to push the mask off my face. The first night I took off but the last two I have adjusted constantly and by the end the headset is so tight to stop the leaks. The second night my report said bad leaks. Last night it said okay - not massive but enough I woke up and had to adjust multiple times. 

So I’m not sure what to do. Is the mask too small? Or should I try a new mask? Like I said the medium fits well at first but once the middle of the night comes and the pressure is high it wants to pop off. I just want to stay asleep and get the full benefit of this.

SleepApnea,"Was hoping to get more insights into turbinate reduction and removals, and it’s impact on Sleep Apnea. 

I 24F, went to two ENTs to get advice of my lifelong nasal congestion. I really want to switch to a nasal pillow, because full face mask is pissing me off. But I can’t really breathe at all through my nose and mostly just mouth breathe. 

The first one advised me a simple 10min laser reduction procedure would be enough to alleviate my breathing difficulties. Although, I was a bit sceptical because it felt like he was rushing through the appointment.

So, I decided to get a second opinion- this ENT first questions if I even have sleep apnea/where I was tested, given my age and gender which is just a lovely reminder for me 🫠 and then suggests a full turbinate removal after seeing my CT scan, as reduction would not be enough.

SleepApnea,"Didgeridoo is a wind instrument. It sounds like a giant fart and annoys my neighbors but I have stopped caring lol. I have taught myself to play proficiently, including circular breathing which took me a few months to master. been playing for a year on and off. Been a musician all my life but never played a wind instrument before so I am proud of becoming proficient at this instrument without formal instruction. When I play didg at least 20 min a day 5 days a week, my sleep quality has an absolute difference. There are many studies on this showing it helps in some cases.

I  wouldn't say it works for everyone because mine is considered a mild case according to my last sleep study hence why my insurance won't cover CPAP. However, when I stop playing didg, my sleep quality becomes so bad that it significantly impairs my quality of life. when I play didg, i actually remember my dreams and i can fall asleep without feeling my airways collapse. I can tell which nights I'm gonna snore because my airways collapse when I'm awake sometimes and i wheez (maybe i have asthma?) and didg makes me immune this while awake lying on my back. i can feel my airways be stronger when i practice regularly.

 I think my sleep apnea is allergy-based and facial structure-based. Doctors said it was from my big tongue but it only get swollen sometimes. there are random nights where i don't have swollen tongue or allergies while awake and i don't snore even when not practicing didg. 

other things that have helped my sleep apnea in the past are:

musinex

albuterol inhaler

pseudophedrine

SleepApnea,"Hi all, 

First time user here. I like my LUNA CPAP but I’m a little confused. The only way to track usage is if you scan the QR code into the app immediately after waking up - if you forget or if it’s incorrect there’s no way to “go back” and view others you haven’t scanned. 

I know for a fact I slept for at least 12 hours last night, and for some reason it’s only reporting being used for 1 hour… did it automatically reset after 12 or something? Other nights it’s accurately stated when I’ve slept 13 hours etc. 

I also know I didn’t click reset overnight. The only reason I’m concerned is because obviously the insurance is tracking how much it’s being used and also I can’t really use any of the results with my doctor for future treatment if it’s not correct.

SleepApnea,"Hey all,

Just thought I'd jot down my time with sleep apnea, and the changes I made to help me deal with it. I think there may be some answers in my experience that might help people live a better life. 

The timeline will be bullet points, and any questions I am happy to answer. 

▪︎2010

• started a new job in cold storage, noticed an increase in appetite to deal with the cold, along with routine nasal stuffiness.

▪︎2012

• noticed my weight had increased, and I had started snoring.
• started training at the gym, but not much happened.

▪︎2014

• Went for a sleep study, was diagnosed with Extreme Severe Sleep Apnea. 
• Tried a CPAP machine, couldn't get any meaningful rest.
• Cut down on carbs and found that my sleep apnea got much less severe.

▪︎2016

• Discovered NiteLase treatment, and it made a very significant difference.  Had to have it every 3 months, but each treatment became shorter lasting.

▪︎2022

• New GP did my laser treatment, mentioned that my airway was super tight. She mentioned her husband had a UPPP, and it was life changing. I got a referral to a surgeon from her.

▪︎2023

• had the UPPP done, along with tonsils and adenoids removed.  The pain was not nearly as bad as I was told it would be, and it has been amazingly beneficial. It was also pretty cheap, between Medicare and my health fund, It cost me $15.65.  I'd have paid $10k. 

My years of constant exhaustion, dosing on meds to stay awake, taking power naps whenever I can and considering offing myself are over. I sleep like a log, it is restful and I'm not waking up to pee every 40 minutes any more. 

I am honestly shocked at the difference, the fact I feel alive again, it's wild. I can't wait to re-engage with life, after losing 10 years to fatigue.

SleepApnea,"Me, female, 37 y/o. Living in Europe. 

I was shockingly diagnosed with severe sleep apnea in Sept. Mostly hypopneas and only a few central. But because the ahi is 71 it's considered severe. 

And I've known about my ruptured left eardrum for over a year. I've seen several ENTS and they don't seem to worry about this at all. They say I can come in for surgery if it bothers me.

I think my eardrum popped after an mri without earplugs. And as a kid I also had my left eardrum ruptured. This healed but I guess it's always been a sensitive spot.

So I was handed a cpap with nasal pillow mask. I wasn't offered a full face mask cause I have epilepsy and my neurologist said that's not safe if I get seizures during the night.
This machine has made me so very ill with severe dizzyness and headaches. Every day I woke up with severe dizzyness, facial pressure, eye pressure and the worse headache ever. I then stopped for a few days and started again. And the same thing happened again. I've tried the cpap for 4 weeks before I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't even get out of bed on my own because I felt so dizzy. It felt like the worst migraine ever, but going on for weeks. So that's not normal. Stopping cpap made it slowly dissappear again.

I've stopped cpap and looked for help. Saw 3 ents. Who said I have a perforated eardrum and a deviated septum. But both doesn't bother them and they don't know why I can't sleep with cpap.

I really wonder if my perforated eardrum can cause symptoms like this? My gp and the ENTS I saw say it can't. But when I google it, there's a lot of information about perforated eardrum and cpap. And ppl with similar issues. But I'm not being heard by the specialsts I've seen.

So I wonder if anyone knows if dizzyness and headaches after a night with cpap can be caused by a perforated eardrum? I feel like everyone acts like it's no big deal. But the cpap pressure can cause ear issues, right? And ear issues can cause dizzyness and headaches, right? Or am I the crazy one here?

When I tell my sleep clinic this, they just say they have no idea. I feel no one has any idea. ENT says many ppl have troubles with cpap and that's that. Uhhh.. I wanna be able to sleep with cpap? But no advice/treatment plan is given. So I'm losing sleep until I know how to tackle this. We've tried every pressure setting there is, I've bought a heated tube. But still to no avail.
I sleep with my mouth open so that's a problem as well. But since I can't use a full face mask, idk how to fix that.

Does anyone have any insight on my severe dizzyness and headaches and a perforated eardrum? Doctors ignore this fact completely. But I feel the ruptured eardrum is big part of my problem. Or it can be. I also suffer neckpain so I'm thinking about 3 options:

* it's cervicogenic headaches and dizzyness coming from the neck. Very strange this has started right after cpap use. I also get tinnitus off and on
* my deviated septum causing problems with the nasal pillow mask
* I also have jawpain and facial pressure. Maybe also coming from the neck or from TMJD
* my perforated eardrum causing issues

What do you guys think? Any advice would be great!
Would a earplug do anything? For the pressure? I'm hoping simple things will make a difference. Cause if I decide to get surgery for the rupture it'll take ages before I can use my cpap again, I guess it needs to heal properly. And I really don't want any surgery. I'm not in any pain. I do have tinnitus off and on and some ear pressure. But no pain. I watch that there's no water getting into my left ear. I use a custom made earplug. My hearing has gone down quite a bit. So that would be a reason to get the surgery done.
But I really don't like going into surgery. So I've decided not to. But if cpap stays a problem because of my ear issue..

SleepApnea,"Hi everybody.

I am a slim 22 yo young man with an infinite number of health issues. My main issue is endless exhaustion. It is not just mental, but rather physical. I bear it on my face and people think I'm a drugie.

I have recently come to the conclusion that I either have a deep neurological issue, or just sleep apnea. Since I am so slim and young, I never considered it before.
But I learnt it could happen to everybody.

I have two questions.

I have a voice that does not carry at all. I have to shout all the time at work, and artficially deepen my voice to be heard. I even have trouble hearing myself when there's some noise around. I have a ghostly voice. I don't think it is low T, as my free T is in range. It is so very strange a symptom, could it be linked to sleep apnea?

Sometimes, during the day, I feel I need more oxygen even though I breathe normally. Could it be indicative of sleep apnea? Of a pipe issue?

SleepApnea,"Hi all,
I started CPAP therapy with my Airsense 11 about 3.5 weeks ago. Prior to starting, I had an AHI of anywhere from 30-60, depending on sleep position. Now, I’ve regularly been below 1.3 AHI and as low as 0.4 some nights while averaging 8 hours a night (can post Oscar charts if helpful). I adapted surprisingly fast to the therapy and the first week was amazing!  I had so much more energy and mental clarity that I didn’t even know what to do with it. Now, after 3 weeks, the past 5 days or so, my energy and mental clarity have dropped off significantly. My brain fog is back in full affect and I’m struggling to get through the days, though nothing has changed with my therapy. I’ve been so tired that the last 3 nights I’ve slept 11 hours each night. I know it’s still early but is it normal to have this big of a drop off early in the treatment as my body and brain heals? I’ve read it can take anywhere from 3 months to a year to heal the grey and white matter in the brain, so I understand it’s not overnight. It’s just been so frustrating seeing what my life could be like and now slipping back into having terrible symptoms again when I’ve been keeping up with the therapy. I have noticed the past few days my dreams have been really vivid with additional nightmares, which I read could be REM rebound and I figured it’s a good sign that things are working.
Only additional thing that changed was it’s been quite a bit more stressful time at work, but it seems hard to believe that could cause such a significant decline in my improvement and cognitive ability. Open to any thoughts/suggestions here to help me out and maybe I’m just being impatient and this is part of the process.

SleepApnea,"I’m probably going to call the Vet Admin hospital on Monday and make an appointment anyways, just wondered if what I’ve been experiencing  is similar to anyone else.  
I’m 36, female, not overweight but I do have high blood pressure that is unmedicated.

All the way through high school I was constantly sleepy in class, used to nap all the time- I would’ve gotten A’s instead of B’s if I hadn’t put my head down.  Actually when I think back about college, I was constantly exhausted all the time.  I started taking Adderall when I was 20 and I felt like I was on top of the world, I could actually focus.  Whooo hoo,   Those are distant memories.

I quit Adderall when I was 24 and joined the army.  Man I remember being so tired I would take naps on the toilet during AIT and other training events.  I always took naps in my car after PT, during lunch, etc.  I also started drinking heavily when I joined the Army.

They say alcohol results in a bad night’s sleep.  I swear to god I can’t fall asleep if I don’t drink.  When I try to sleep sober I’ll start to drift off, and I twitch and wake up gasping because I think I stop breathing.  This happens over and over for hours.  I wake up exhausted.  If drink a bottle of wine I wake up bright eyed and bushy tailed.  I end up drinking when I don’t want to.  This happens even after an extended period of not drinking, it’s not a physical dependence on alcohol.

Btw I don’t get the shakes n stuff if I don’t drink… I just feel exhausted, unless I take Adderall.  It’s hard to function and I’m slowly poisoning myself.

SleepApnea,"Hi all. I use the Airsense 10 machine and the DreamWear Full Face Mask. I’ve tried a few masks, and this is the one that’s the most comfortable for me.
I’ve been having to purchase a new mask about every 2-3 weeks, lately, because it seems that after a several proper washes, I have issues with the seal. Even sometimes if I just wipe it down with a cleaning wipe, that night, I’ll have a ton of leakage and it’ll not go back to a proper seal, even after a few days.

Has anyone else had this issue?
What is your washing protocol?

I wipe my mask down each night, and every 3-4 days, I clean the mask, frame, and tube.

Study showed I slept 7 hours. 5 hours on back (AHI 7) and 2 hours on side ( AHI 13).

1) EXTRA LOUD snoring... (Wife has to move to another bedroom in the middle of the night, she can't sleep)

2) Always tired and sleepy (24/7 no matter how much I sleep)

5) Sometimes headaches in the morning.

I am skinny fat, 195lbs 5'11'' dont smoke drink socially. Drinking makes me snore at night however my wife says I do not snore when I am sober. 

Side sleeper. Ever since I can remember I have had a strange problem. One nostril is always clogged to the point where a pressure builds when laying on that side. As soon as I roll over and switch sides the clog slowly moves to that nostril. I don't understand it. The clog makes it impossible to sleep soundly. I have been dealing with it for years, it will not go away. Its not allergies, or colds, It is constant every night for years. I have dried humidifiers too. Laying on my back slightly decreases the clog. Mucus is associated with the clog. 

The only that that clears it up is nasal decongestant however the relief is short lived and the clog comes back later in the night after the medicine wears off.

SleepApnea,"I've been using my new machine, a ResMed AirSense since Thanksgiving now, covered by insurance. Since it's being paid for, I'm in that 90-day monitoring phase where they check to see that I'm using it for so many hours a night, etc.

I've been getting some rainout and realized it's because my machine does not have a heated hose. I called the machine providers to see if I could get one but they said I'd need to get a prescription from my doctor. I'm wondering if it would just be easier to buy the heated hose myself, but I don't want to mess up any insurance requirements, and I don't know if the hose type is something they can see from monitoring my usage.

So my question is, could I buy a new hose for my machine just on my own, or would there be complications with insurance that could void my machine's coverage?

When I don't use my Cpap I get severe headaches and I get like a sore feel in epiglotus. 

What I wanted to was was, if ur sleeping on your stomach, why is it not enough to treat sleep apnea?

If there is no obstruction, what still causes the condition?

I think I have some issue in my nose too, which might be contributing to it.

I am fine using a cpap but if I have the option or some way thst I can sleep, and wake up refreshed, I'd like to explore that. Cpap is very troublesome during travel too.

**What are you using to monitor your sleep?**

I  read that the Apple Watch is quite good at it but I didn't buy one  since teh Series 1, also because I don't even know when you should  charge it if it has to monitor your sleep while being on.

I  remember seeing some kind of ""clockless"" wrist watch at an Apple Store a  couple of years ago, it seemed exactly like a sleep monitor but I  really can't find it again.

All the non-wearables sleep monitors seems not that precise and I am ok with wearing something to monitor my sleep.

**So that's about it, which ""setup"" would you recommend?**

Keep  in mind - I already saw a doctor and I have a deviated septum, but both  the nose and the snoring is not too bad to get a surgery, so I am in  the middle of trying a less intrusive solution before having the surgery  that is not that much needed (this is what the doctor suggested for  this year) - avoid CPAP and try with something else - I don't have sleep  apnea.",t2_q7mbl1zz,0,"Snore Monitoring - what do you use?

- horrible tmj and tmdd pain 
- jaw clicking and popping sound when I swallow 
- teeth grinding even still with a night guard 
- overactive bladder symptoms that wake me up often 
- snoring (people telling me I snore a bit) 
- waking up with dry mouth and sore throat and sore upper nose feeling (I know this is obviously from snoring but just listing anyway) 
- waking up many times in the night from strange, vivid nightmares. Many times in my dreams I feel myself breathing shallow and it feels weird and scary and I force myself to wake up if my body doesn’t 
- periods of frequent sleep paralysis 
- headaches every single time I wake up no matter what

SleepApnea,"Suffered from mental health issues (anxiety, depression, OCD, insomnia, etc) for most of my life. I've seen therapists and had been on different medications but nothing ever helped. Recently diagnosed with sleep apnea (15.7 AHI) and I think this has been the primary cause for a lot of my issues, and why nothing has ever helped before. 

Unfortunately, I have struggled a lot sticking with the CPAP due to my anxiety / insomnia issues. I don't want to get into a lot of detail about my mental health issues but I honestly am not sure if I will ever be able to be consistent with the CPAP.

SleepApnea,"Hi all, about 3 weeks ago I began CPAP therapy for my severe sleep apnea and it has been going surprisingly well. I’ve been averaging over 8 hours a night with an AHI usually below 1. I’ve already noticed an increase in energy which has been a god send. One problem I have been noticing though is that I feel like I am getting angry and upset in situations I normally wouldn’t. I am a very even keel person who does not get upset easily. Problem is, the past couple weeks, the smallest things are setting me off, and I don’t know what to do about it. I am afraid this will negatively impact my loved ones and I don’t want to do that. I just have so much more aggression and anger at small things that I have never experienced in my life. Could this be from an increase in testosterone since now I’m actually getting good rest? That is more of a guess but I just don’t know what to do about it. Even today, I couldn’t get my desk chair at the correct height for a while which led to standing up, kicking the chair and flipping it over on its side. It’s scary right now because I feel like this isn’t like me at all. Would be very welcome to hearing anyone's thoughts or ideas about what could be going on.

SleepApnea,"Hello r/SleepApnea,  


First and foremost, love the community here! It's great to see people sharing their experiences and wins, and feels great to feel seen in my own challenges with sleep apnea. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping to pick the subreddit's collective brain and see if anyone had any tips. I'm doing a follow-up in-person sleep study as soon as I can get the referral processed and an appointment, but was hoping folks might have some suggestions in the meantime. 

I was diagnosed last year with severe obstructive sleep apnea averaging about 35 events an hour. I'm in my late 20s, fairly physically active but a bit overweight (just over 6 foot, 230lb), and they think my sleep apnea was brought on by likely a combination of two COVID infections back-to-back coupled with my having gained weight (primarily related to chronic pain, ate like how I used to eat when I could be doing 100 more things than I can now!). Working on the weight piece, and on the sleep apnea side I was set up by a great clinic with a ResMed AirSense11 AutoSet. I originally started with the nose pillows but found that with my nasal congestion (looking into causation here, using the CPAP seems to help clear it), it was hard to breathe at times and I was taking it off, so we switched to an F&amp;P Vitera full face mask. I've been using the machine every night for over 3 months now but the issue I've come up against is that after about 1.5-2 hours of sleep, I'm taking it off subconsciously. I'm also the type where even though my oxygen levels drop a lot, I'm not waking myself up. My heart rate spikes and everything (I track my sleep with a FitBit) but I remain unconscious. We've played around with humidity, heat, and pressure settings a bit, and currently have me on fixed pressure as I was having more central apnea events with auto pressure.  


Hope that gives folks a decent general overview of my situation - my main question is how have others dealt with the taking off of the mask subconsciously? My partner has joked about stapling the mask to my face but short of that, any thoughts or suggestions worth trying out to help me keep it on? I'd love to have a proper night's sleep and stop feeling like garbage each time when I wake up.

SleepApnea,"Hi, I'm in the process of getting diagnosed for sleep apnea. I did a home test and had an AHI of 27. I just did a comprehensive sleep study a few days ago and am now waiting for the results. In the meantime, I was wondering if anyone had similar symptoms.

* Lightheadedness/dizziness
* Tension headache
* Heavy eyelids/weirdly sleepy
* Tense neck and shoulders
* GERD
* IBS-like stomach issues

I get all of these all day long, not just in the morning.

I've been a snorer since I was a child and my entire family snores, so I always thought it was normal.

A couple of months ago, I was busy and didn't sleep all that much for a couple of weeks. I went to a restaurant after a busy morning and ended up having my first panic attack, or what felt like it anyway. All the above symptoms then came on throughout the span of a month and I started waking up multiple times at night.

I've done an MRI, MRA, and other sorts of scans. I've been to a psychiatrist. I don't have depression or bipolar, and I'm not a textbook case of anxiety either (according to my doctors).

I have managed to become somewhat functional after completely changing my lifestyle around. I have a morning and night routine now. I am in bed by 10 pm. I make sure not to do too much during the day. I meditate and journal. I lost 7 kilograms from not being able to eat due to the stomach issues, and now that I can, I am seeing a nutritionist and working on losing weight since I am obese. I am even getting therapy, which has helped me cope through the trauma of the last couple of months and deal with life being tired all the time. I also do acupuncture.

Only, even with all the above, I have been feeling more tired as time goes by, not less. I tracked and recorded my sleep, which was how I found out I probably had sleep apnea. I just want to know that I'm not alone in this, and that I'll find some relief by treating it.

Using a CPAP machine was such a game changer and I had no beef with it. I was finally getting good sleep. Fast forward 5 years later my weight and depression spiraled out of control. I decided it was time to make a permanent lifestyle change and started a strict diet + exercise regiment. Long story short, I lost a massive amount of weight. I fell asleep without my mask by accident and the sleep tracker app on my Apple Watch said I had better REM sleep that night than the past few nights with my mask. I started laying down at the same angle I wasn’t able to breathe through my nose previously and I was actually able to breathe!! I was still skeptical. I decided to sleep without my machine for a week and I woke up feeling fine every morning. Finally, during New Year’s Eve weekend, I asked my friend who I was sharing a hotel with if I snored at all during my sleep or sounded like i was struggling (he’s heard me struggle without my machine before) and he made note to actually remember to check and told me he didn’t hear anything for 2 nights.

SleepApnea,"I know it varies from workplace to workplace, but I was curious. 

I currently work from home but I have a fixed schedule (call center work) 

I’m in the process of getting diagnosed with central sleep apnea to get a BIPAP machine as my CPAP is not cutting it and my obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis was pretty bs anyways. 

Side affects include randomly getting so tired I’m straight up incapable of working. 

I’ve fallen asleep on break a handful of times, causing me to miss 1-2 hours of work. I’ve honestly even fallen asleep on calls, although that’s less severe as it’s only for a brief lapse and it really just means I have to ask some clarifying questions to get what I missed. 

I was considering trying to get an accommodation wherein I wouldn’t be penalized for needing to take a longer break, since ultimately what is hours of feeling brain dead and exhausted can often be remedied by a 15-30 minute nap, if only to get myself to a functional point. Trying to work through it just makes it worse.

SleepApnea,"I started CPAP a few days ago, and I'm starting to encounter the same problem every night, which is that after a few hours the mask will start to slip around on my face and leak.

I'm using a ResMed Airfit 20, which has a silicon cushion. I find that the cushion kind of unfolds itself so that it's no longer pressing against my skin, but kind of flapping free. I've tried tightening the mask more, and less, and checking that it's tightened evenly on both sides, but so far nothing is working. I think it's partly that my face becomes a little sweaty, so that allows the silicon to slip. And once it happens, I can't get it to stop so I just give up for the night.

SleepApnea,"**TL;DR: how did you deal with w CPAP as a stomach sleeper?**

I was diagnosed with extremely severe sleep apnea (AHI=70) and I’m receiving the recommendation this week. I’m worried I’ll be pointed toward a CPAP. 

I don’t think it would work due to my sleep habits.
1) I sleep face-down and cannot easily fall into deep sleep in any other position; a mask could prevent that. 
2) I’m also an extremely active sleeper and worried I’ll literally pull the machine off the bedstand or get the tube wrapped around my neck or something (granted this could be due to the apnea). I’m aware this is more out-there.

Desaturing into the 50s and after being on BiPap for hours, co2 was at 55 ( via ABG ).

So the doctors did not want him to leave without a machine. Now we are at a point where insurance won’t cover because he needs and ABG 7+ points above his highest of 55. So he was sent home to get worse.

SleepApnea,"Hi all- your advice helped me get my husband (50) tested (I begged him for years, and my fears after a friend died finally convinced him). I have searched here and can’t find anything similar to this predicament. He (reluctantly) got a home test 6 months ago, which I can’t put my hands on right now, but “moderate” and “obstructive” SA were in there. His primary doc spoke with him about the test and recommended cpap, but apparently said “only about 60% of people can tolerate it”. You get where I’m going with this. Husband doesn’t want to shell out all that money (we can afford it) for something that “probably won’t work for him”. And then sends me medical studies about how they don’t prevent death, after all, etc.

Background- borderline obese, his dad had sleep apnea, and I’ve been telling him for years he snores and stops breathing often during the night. Drinks most nights, sometimes up to a bottle of wine. It’s much worse on those heavy drinking nights. I sometimes don’t even hear the apneas on non-drinking nights (though you all told me he most likely still has apneas).  He’s not willing to stop drinking. Always says he’s trying to cut down, and also always trying to lose weight. 

He doesn’t fall asleep during the day at all, but often talks about being tired in the evenings, and sometimes goes to bed early. Claims that the cats or his bladder (not apnea) wake him up bt 4-5am most days, and he can’t go back to sleep. Says he just needs less sleep than other people. So he has no desire or incentive to try a cpap. 

He’s now possibly even more more hesitant to do a CPAP, since he “hated having all that stuff attached” to himself during the test. 

Anyone had any similar path, and had a positive result if CPAP was finally tried? I can’t help but think if he tries it and can get used to it, that he will sleep through the night better. And feel better, have more energy to work out more often, etc. I mentioned maybe he could rent one to try it? The only other thing I’ve seen is sleeping on one’s side, and he says “I do sleep on my side“. But he always ends up on his back, and that’s when the audible apneas happen. Would possibly be open to the ball on his back. 

Any thoughts?? Just give up? Lol.

SleepApnea,"I have sleep apnea, and I’m supposed to use a CPAP machine at night to control it. I used to be very compliant with it, and would rarely fall asleep without putting on my mask. It’s annoying and uncomfortable and unsexy, and I just kinda stopped using it altogether at some point without really making a conscious decision to stop using it. Research on CPAP adherence indicates that a lot of folks are in the same boat as me, too.

I’ve recently realized that I need to make it a habit again to use it every night, because it’s for my own good. I started using it again a few nights ago, and I’m already waking up feeling well-rested, not getting easily fatigued throughout the day, and not waking up with headaches regularly. I had forgotten how much better I feel during the day when I use my CPAP at night, but I’m glad I’ve rediscovered how important it is.

SleepApnea,"Hey everybody.  35yo male, 6ft tall 265lbs with history of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (remission) and right sided TLE (Temporal Lobe Epilepsy) along with a small stroke in the left side of my brain this past September.  Neuro ordered an at home sleep study after the stroke and I unfortunately have been way too busy with work to get it done until this last week.  Finally left my job to start a new 100% work from home job that will be much healthier for me overall so I picked up the overnight Sleep Study kit and strapped it on for the night.  Dropped it off the next day and just got my results today.  

Here is what it says:

"" Your sleep study shows obstructive sleep apnea with 9 events (times where your breathing stopped or decreased enough to lower blood oxygen) per hour. Your oxygen saturation went as low as 78% (&gt;90% is normal). I am ordering CPAP and you should hear from Apria in the next week. Once you get your CPAP, it is very important that you use it regularly to help stay awake the next day and to reduce your risk of stroke, heart failure, and high blood pressure. I would like to see you back within 4-6 weeks.""

I am obviously scared that my blood oxygen is getting that low but I also don't feel like I totally understand the extent of how bad this is or isn't.  My Neuro emailed me and didn't call so I haven't had a chance to speak to them yet.  Any insight from you all would be greatly appreciated.

My oropharynx (see referenced picture above) is only 3mm at best. 

There is nothing causing the airways to be blocked (nasopharynx ) or small (oropharynx )--they're just small or underdeveloped if you will. I.e.: there is no abnormal growth, deviated septum, invasive cyst/polyp/issue, etc.

I have been informed by one (trusted and great) professional that any surgerical options will simply reduce the amount of pressure I require with my APAP/CPAP treatment, and that there is no way to enlarge the airways so that I can actually be ""cured"" of sleep apnea. 

Main question: Are there truly no surgical options available that can fix this so that I can get a good nights sleep?

SleepApnea,"I've been dealing with sleep apnea for 2+ years now and have tried sleeping in the below (order from consistent best sleep to lowest)

1. $20 air mattress (with various foam soft/firm pillows propping my legs and slight head elevation)
2. Hammock -portable (this might be ""better"" than #1 however I usually wake up more ""tired"" throughout the day - later this year I'll have a better room setup where I can test this out)
3. Memory foam mattresses - I've tried a $80-$800 dollar foam mattresses and TBH after all my research/testing the cheap IKEA foam mattresses ($150 or less) are my favorite, I even had my family and friends come over since I had 5+ mattresses (foam,spring,hybrid,etc..) and the general consensus was the cheap IKEA foam mattress.
4. Sleeping on the ground with a triangle pillow wedge (this is how I slept initially with my first sleep apnea test and my test results did not show apnea however when I went into the sleep lab my apnea showed due to me not using my SnoreRX guard + nasal dilators as I had them on during my first test)  


Things I use:

1. SnoreRX guard (makes a huge difference)
2. Nasal Dilators
3. \*Hydrogen peroxide/Rubbing Alc (on days were im too lazy to fully clean/scrub my masks/guard/dilators I pour some into my cpap water tank shake my machine a lil bit and then rinse the rest of my gear with it - remember the more consistent you use your cpap the more likely you'll have a good night rest.
4. Turkey slices
5. Magnesium supplements

SleepApnea," Four years ago, I was diagnosed with a severe case of sleep apnea (33 AHI). The doctors believe that I have had it for ten years. Despite using CPAP (0 AHI), the impact of sleep apnea on my life has been significant, making it difficult for me to function. At the age of 45, I am an engineer and had to quit my job for a less demanding one with lower pay. I do not have children now, but I feel that I would not be able to handle being a parent or care for a child. I am socially withdrawn most of the time because I don't have the energy or mood to do so. Using CPAP has helped but still nothing like before.

SleepApnea,"Is anyone here familiar with central apnea, where the brain stops sending signals to breathe? 

My son (3M) has been having trouble with sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness for almost a year now. He’s restless at night, moving around a ton, wakes up and comes to our room to sleep with us. Sometimes it’s hard to get him to fall asleep at night (has taken 2+ hours laying with him in a dark room with no distractions) or sometimes he’s out within 15 minutes of laying down. He wakes up exhausted in the mornings. (7:30pm bedtime with 6:20 am wake up, out the door for daycare by 6:45 M-F). 

He not only still naps during the day, but it’s a solid 3 hour nap at least. He gets extremely irritable if he’s tired. 

He had a sleep study done in November 2022 and had 54 apnea episodes. Two were minimal and obstructive, the other 52 were central apnea. That’s a crazy amount for just an 8 hour sleep (they let him go to sleep around 8 pm and had us up by 5:30 am). 

No full wake-ups that night but a lot of partial arousals, some PLM where he was violently thrashing and woke me up. 

Both ENTs that saw him, his normal physician and the sleep medicine specialist said his tonsils and adenoids look fine and like they aren’t a problem.

Sleep medicine specialist wants a brain MRI to look for a chiari malformation but they’re stumped.

SleepApnea,"I have had sleep issues and various physical / mental health problems my entire life. I am 26 now, recently diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea (AHI of only 15.7), and am thinking most the problems of the problems I have had in life may be because of this. 

Things have gotten very bad the past few years. I'm not sure how much of it can be attributed to sleep apnea, but I am extremely burned out and have been barely able to function. Some examples of my life  :

&amp;#x200B;

* I am stressed out basically from when I wake up until I fall asleep.
* I can't concentrate on anything. I can't even sit down to watch a movie or play video games.
* I can barely talk to people or hold a conversation.
* I can barely exercise due to low energy and joint pain.
* I can't stay asleep. I wake up constantly with my heart racing.
* Crippling anxiety, OCD, GAD, depression, etc
* Have basically lived in a state of depersonalization for the past \~5 years

It feels like I am stuck in a loop of poor sleep and mental health problems and it is literally killing me. I have seen multiple therapists, been through 7 different medications for mental health issues / insomnia, and had a ton of other bloodwork and tests done to look for other issues. Nothing helps.

I can't even put into words how broken I feel. I am thinking of quitting my job and checking myself into some kind of facility. I don't even have the mental capacity to sit down and figure out my CPAP, and nights where I try to use it I always sleep worse.

SleepApnea,"Apologies in advance and fair warning that I am new to this and may not be using all the proper terms.  
  
About a year ago I started experiencing symptoms of sleep apnea. It was rare and admittedly I didn't pay much attention to it until it started becoming more frequent and my fiance noticed that my breathing would stop while sleeping sometimes. Eventually I then started experiencing heart palpitations, along with dizziness and vertigo in the early afternoons. At this point I started seriously looking into sleep apnea, I stopped putting it off and went to the doctor.  
  
The doctor ordered a sleep study and referred me to a cardiologist. In short, I was told that the sleep study did capture ""apneatic episodes"", but because my oxygen level never got below 92, that I don't actually *have* sleep apnea. I wore a heart monitor twice - once for 5 days and again for about 20 days. Each time I was told that they aren't capturing anything of concern. In addition, my echocardiogram revealed a perfectly healthy heart. While I'm glad to hear that of course, it's frustrating that they can't tell me anything other than something is triggering my palpitations and other symptoms and that I need to figure out what my trigger is.  
  
I've always been a back sleeper and since switching to my sides, my sleep apnea symptoms seem to have gone away. I do still experiencing the heart palpitations sometimes, but only at night while sleeping. 
  
I'm a 37 year old male, I'm not overweight, I exercise regularly (with no breathing or heart issues). I'm pretty content in my life, I have a job, I'm financially stable. I've had no significant dietary changes, no medications. While I can't rule out that there's some kind of subconscious stress that is causing my symptoms, I really have no idea what it would be. What I'm experiencing is basically being written off by doctors and yet I don't know what the root cause is, so my concern is that these symptoms are still damaging and/or leading to a higher risk of heart problems and I feel pretty helpless about it at this point.  
  
Obviously I don't expect anyone to diagnose it, but was wondering if anyone has gone through a similar experience and what their next steps were. 
  
TLDR - I'm experiencing sleep apnea but am told I don't *have* it. I've put a ""band-aid"" on the apnea for now by side-sleeping, but I'm being told that overall I'm healthy and so I don't know how to treat what I'm experiencing.",t2_f54hy,0,Experiencing sleep apnea but testing negative,[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,103dp6c,True,manticor225,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/103dp6c/experiencing_sleep_apnea_but_testing_negative/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/103dp6c/experiencing_sleep_apnea_but_testing_negative/,34224,1672863276,0,,False,1672863291,1672863292,2023-01-04 20:14:36,,,,,,,

Starting about 15 years ago, I was finally able to start getting treatment ( BiPap and surgery) for my apnea. It was life changing, I went from feeling like I was wearing a lead suit and a stupid helmet, to being functional. I had constant muscle and bone pain, could not function at all.  Then got turbinates surgery and a BiPap. It was great! The muscle and bone pain stopped, I could even think. Then I accidently dumped the reservoir through my machine by nearly dropping it. It never worked reliably again. Didn't have good insurance for a few years, so I couldn't replace it.   
About six years ago, I got one that was set after half assed and deliberately faulty sheep studies. It was never right. After about 8 waking hours, I would steadily decline. My crash point, as I called it, varied from about 10 hours after waking to about 4 hours. After that, I wasn't useful. Like a phone battery with a bad charger, you never know how much battery percentage you'll have when you wake up.
Now, I'm functional!

SleepApnea,"I've had 3 sleep studies done, I have mild apnea 5 AHI or less. I can't tolerate CPAP or APAP and it makes my sleep so much worse.

SleepApnea,"Hi there, 
I was just diagnosed with severe sleep apnea about 2 weeks ago. I am still waiting to start cpap therapy but had a question about a weird symptom I have been having and was curious if anyone else has experienced it before. I have slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit which led to the having a sleep study done along with the traditional symptoms such as excessive daytime fatigue, snoring and gasping for air. I have a reported AHI of over 40 (based on the little bit I slept). I have had symptoms of sleep apnea for over 3 years but never took my partners reports of me snoring/gasping too seriously (stupid of me I know) until it continuously got worse, I have gained an additional 40 pounds this year from lack of exercise and over eating due to extreme lack of energy (working on this already and have goals to lose the extra weight ASAP and am hopeful CPAP will help from an energy standpoint-I am aware it will not be a fix all solution and will require dedication on my part as well). I know people have more severe AHI than mine and I’m not sure if over 40 would explain the extreme fatigue I have been having (feels like I am dying at some points) I try to keep going with daily life, I work 2 jobs one of which is physical and work over 50 hours for week. It has been extremely difficult and outside working I have pretty much neglected all of my other relationships due to excessive fatigue. I deal with irritability a lot of the time which has definitely affected my relationship with my family, friends and partners. I have also dealt with the unusual symptom of joint and muscle pain which I haven’t heard of being as common as a symptom and was curious if anyone else dealt with that or if I could have some other problems going on as well. Just curious to hear how cpap helped other people and if any of the things I mentioned affected others as well and if CPAP helped. I feel very alone sometimes as I don’t really know anyone else my age who deals with sleep apnea(25 female for reference) and feel it is very isolating 😔 I also deal with anxiety and depression and diagnosed ADHD and have been medicated for all these conditions with multiple medication and while they helped a little bit I never received enough relief to warrant staying on as a result of the side effects (If they helped more I would for sure have put up with the side effects). Wondering also if anyone experienced any of this as well that could be related to sleep apnea. I often feel like I will be like this forever and feel like giving up 😔

Thanks for reading this long post and any information/advice is appreciated

* Can the technicians know whats wrong with your sleep? For instance i don't mouthbreath, barely snore, don't move while sleeping (recorded myself with a cam and asked relative to check me) yet it feels unrestfull
* Can it rule other problem? For exemple if one phase of my sleep is too light, might be because of something else than my sleep then can the data/technician helps me understand deeper?

I get this weird feeling like I stop breathing during the transition period where I'm almost about to fall asleep.

I saw a post on this subreddit where someone mentioned that hyperventilation can happen if the pressure isn't high enough. But I recall at one point I was at a slightly higher 8mm with no exhale relief, and I had the same problem. Should I be at an even higher level?

Also, would a Bipap help for someone like me who is only at 7mm? I've read that Bipaps can go down to zero pressure on exhale, so would that be worth trying? Or should I ask to do another sleep study with an Apap instead?

Got bloodwork done, everything was fine, so I went to a sleep specialist. Did an at home sleep apnea test. Basically, he said I have mild sleep apnea, which could be causing my problems, but also might not. So he gave me a prescription for either an oral appliance or CPAP machine.

CPAP sounded fucking awful, so I was gonna try the oral appliance, but it would be $2,800 and insurance wouldnt cover. Both my grandfather and dad have had CPAP machines in the past, so I was gonna try one of those, but now they're nowhere to be seen. 

So now we're having to drop a ton of money on a CPAP, which might help but also might not. In my non doctor opinion, I think my issue is delayed sleep phase syndrome, not ""mild"" sleep apnea. I cant imagine mild sleep apnea would make me this extremely tired, when people with much worse sleep apnea are able to push through life never knowing about their condition, albeit slightly miserable.

SleepApnea,"Hello,
I have had recent success with seeing a naturopath. Apparently immflamation wasn’t a possible solution to my issue but surgery was according to the three ENTs I have seen. 
I was diagnosed with mild positional sleep apnea and was having trouble with my turbinates blocking my airway (UARS). I would wake up and not be able to breathe through one side of my nostrils - usually my left 98% of the time. 
There was talk of me getting a Cpap and surgery. 
But I was nervous of surgery and empty nose syndrome. 
I started seeing a naturopath and he prescribed a nose spray for my nose to help remove any possible bio film and hence reduce immflamation. The spray contained luigols iodine. 
It has worked. I have been symptom free for weeks now. I would suggest going through all options before doing a CPAP and definitely surgery. Try out a naturopath. 
I know my case was very mild but if you are able to, it would pay to make sure. I have suffered with blockage issues since Jan. 2020 
I wanted to share my good news and hopefully make people aware of a possible solution and look at immflamation reduction before something drastic or irreversible like surgery.

I’ve tried using nasal strips, nasal dilators, I have a air purifier in my room, I even got used to sleeping with extra pillows, different kinds of nasal sprays and it’s slight improvements but not anything significant. I was on allergy medicine but I’m trying to step away from the medication. I really don’t want to get the surgery but now Im starting to consider it.

SleepApnea,"Early 20s here. I had DJS a year ago and honestly it didn't help my OSA. I had and still have a lot of issues with nasal breathing that seem to be tied to allergies and inflammation. I had a septoplasty and turbinate reduction done at the same time as my DJS. The only structure that could be affecting my nasal breathing are my adenoids afaik. The only weird thing is that nasal sprays haven't really helped with this, and almost all the doctors I've seen say my adenoids look fine...

I had to take a break from college last year because of DJS, and I thought I'd be getting good sleep and be functional this year.

I'm having the most difficulty exhaling. Even when it's ramping and the pressure is only at 4, I get chest pains and feel like I really have to work hard to exhale (nose or mouth). If I'm not actively paying attention to my breathing on CPAP, I unconsciously hold my breath and don't realize it until I'm gasping for air.  I think that is registering as a central apnea and causing the pressure to go up making me feel even worse. 

I've been able to do 2 hours at a time while awake, but even that gives me chest pains and headaches. It also makes my chronic jaw pain from bruxism and hypermobility much worse. 

I have my doubts about the sleep study results, because my AHI is only an issue when I am supine, and I normally sleep on my side. I was only on my back, because it was the only way to get comfortable with the equipment. However, it also calculated AHI based on  the 8 hours I was wearing the equipment, and I \*barely\* slept. So I think my actual AHI could be higher or lower and I have no idea which. 

I guess I just don't know if this level of pain and struggle is normal at such a low setting and with very mild apnea. I have life long problems with sleep, so I am symptomatic.

SleepApnea,"Hello everyone,

I am a 20 year old male, writing my first post here as I don't have a clue what to do not to stay depressed and fatigued all my life. I would be extremely grateful for any help.

Since 5 months I have a problem with fatigue and sleepiness throughout the day. It started to become more severe since 2 months and now I'm enlightened and I think that it connects with my mental health as a whole.

I try to sleep at least 8-9 hours a day, not eat sugar and sweets, workout 3x a week, meditate once daily etc.

Despite that, it is extremely hard to wake up, last few days best I can do is 10am, even though my alarm clock is set to 8.30 . I am not fatigued all day, but most of it. I often get bored and want to sleep while reading a book or watching a movie or while learning - which makes me stressed about future exams at my university. 

I have trouble maintaining erection with my GF (i am still a virgin), and despite the fact that we are together for nearly a year I am starting to feel a little bit pressured about not being able to stay hard with her - and it greatly reflects on our relationship. Urologist says everything is fine, but his prescribed Cialis (tadalafil) did pretty much nothing for me - even though my girlfriend is extremely supportive and I am a confident, good-looking guy, I lose my erection so it never really got to real sex. Worrying thing is I didn't reach an orgasm once during our 11-month relationship. 

I pretty much do not watch porn and I rarely masturbate - a little bit more often lately cause of my poor mental health and crisis, which is based on thoughts that I will stay like this until end of my life and I will end up harming myself, not being able to improve or do anything if all i want to do is to sleep - but when I go to bed for a nap, I am unable to fall asleep.

I am allergic and I snore - I usually get a score from 1 to 8 in the SnoreLab app measuring the loudness and frequency of snoring - based on that I do not think I have sleep apnea, as my snoring sound does not sound like i have some pauses while breathing. But I still do snore though.

I have recently noticed slight bloating in myself, and some time ago the ENT specialist told me that I have reflux.  I am quite sure I breathe through my mouth while sleeping, because I wake up with a dry mouth feeling.

Blood tests from November are in norm, my TSH score was 2,9 but I guess it might be too high for a man my age? (20 yo)

Should I test my testosterone, go for a sleep study, go to an endocrinologist?

I would be very happy to respond to anyone who has/had any similar conditions or would like to help.

SleepApnea,"Hey there

I want to get the Bimaxillary Mandibular Advancement for a multitude of reasons that I can answer in the comments but I know that a big hurdle is insurance.

I have blue cross blue shield thru work and my Dr says I should qualify.

I did a take home sleep study last night and COULD NOT SLEEP AT ALL.

It was not due to the equipment but rather my inability to breathe. In my 5.5 years of using my CPAP I have only not used it 6 or so nights, all involuntarily. 

I love my CPAP but it is a ball and chain (I cant sleep or nap in planes, trains, or automobiles.....or tents for that matter)


So probably at the 6.5 hour mark I said ""maybe I can wear my CPAP for like an hour or two and then take it off, hopefully falling to sleep without the mask due to tiredness""

3 hours later I woke up feeling fresh but realizing my plan failed: I had slept through the alarm. 

Mind you, I was wearing both my CPAP and the sleep study. 

Is the insurance company going to see how well I slept and say ""well the dude obviously doesn't need surgery, he sleeps well on his CPAP and is an incredibly diligent user""?

SleepApnea,"So I have severe obstructive sleep apnea- and central sleep apnea - the sleep study said my AHI was 99. I'm still waiting for a BIPAP machine. There's a shortage right now and it might take a while.

But on top of all of this, I have Barret's Esophagus and gastroparesis, with my GERD worsening for mysterious reasons (despite being on PPIs and monitoring my diet, etc.) so they want to give me an upper endoscopy- I'm due, anyway, since they give me one every 3 years.

I told my GI doc about the sleep apnea and they said they're scheduling an OR for the procedure so that they can have an anesthesiologist and keep an eye on my apnea. But I'm still worried.

SleepApnea,"I'm 19 years old.

Recently, I've been waking up after 4-5 hours of sleep. I go to the bathroom and then go back to sleep again. I noticed the same thing would happen again, but this time after what I presumably think is a single sleep cycle. I have a dream or a couple of dreams, and after they finish, I wake up right after.

I don't like this because I ended up sleeping like for 10 hours just from constantly trying to fall back asleep again.

In Christmas eve, I went to sleep quite late (3 a. m), and I slept normally (7-8 hours of sleep). I used my phone during those hours, so I don't think it's a sleep hygiene issue.

I gotta mention that previous to this, I had been suffering from insomnia because of anxiety issues where I tried ambien for a while. I used to sleep normally until I started to worry about my sleep quality because that's when all of this began.

I started to get better now, reconditioning myself to associate bed with sleep, but this strange waking periods is something I don't quite understand...

**Important details**

 - I can't recall a day where I felt ""Truly rested"".
- When I was a child, I got pneumonia and they put on me a breathing machine. I can recall perfectly how amazing I felt after using it the following days.

SleepApnea,"tl;dr M44 diagnosed with central apnea after sleep test, 39 events per hour. Started on Resmed Airsense 11 five weeks ago. Woke up with mask on for the first time this morning and I feel worse than ever. Any advice welcome, especially regarding experience with ASV (Adaptive Servo Ventilation) as alternative to CPAP.


Story time:

A year ago, I started suffering from chronic fatigue,  mood swings and depression after recovering from my third bout of covid. It was chalked up as long-covid and I followed a regime of physiotherapy, exercise and mental councilling. Recovery was slow, but progress was made. 

My wife has been telling me for nearly 20 years that I stop breathing in my sleep, so my GP suggested a sleep test which found that I suffered from 39 central events per hour. We theorised that my existing condition was laggravated by covid and could be the cause of all my problems. I was issued with a Resmed Airsense 11 and an F&amp;P Eson 2 nose mask and got to work.

After an initial honeymoon period I had trouble keeping the mask on over night. It did not seal well, I hated the thing between my eyes and the tugging on my face... At this point I accepted my fate and went into full geek mode until my CPAP setup was fully optimised. 

My sleep score slowly improved and I became pretty comfortable with the whole thing. But here comes the kicker: I just felt worse and worse. This morning I finally woke up with my mask on and I feel so tired I can cry. 

The mask was slightly displaced and partially obstructed one nostril, so perhaps that is why my pulse was racing and my blood oxygen saturation in the low 90s.

SleepApnea,"Hey, I just turned 17 and one year after it started I have finally found what was causing me all these issues. It was severe sleep apnea(54 ahi an hour). Thanks to this community and google I was able to find out what was happening to me and talked to my doctor about it and got a sleep study done. The thing that shocks me is that I and many people who have sleep apnea could have so easily found this out way earlier if there was more awareness and if doctors had been more aware of the symptoms. When I first went to my doctor about 9 months ago, I told him about waking up at night many times, feeling unrefreshed, dry mouth and I had high blood pressure (140/90). Despite these symptoms the doctor never once suspected it was sleep apnea. Instead he gave me medication for sleep apnea called zopiclne(this messed me up in so many different ways but thats another story). In conclusion, We need to spread awareness about this condition so more people could be helped. I have created an instagram account solely for spreading awareness and have messaged more than 800 people in my school letting them know that If they are having these symptoms it could be sleep apnea and that they should get checked out. I know I am alot luckier than many people here who went untreated for years and as a result have brain damage and health issues. Although I hate the cpap I am still getting used to it.

SleepApnea,"I believe my apnea is caused by the strange stomach issues I’ve been suffering with for the past 6 months (which entails bloating + indigestion where I feel like im being choked sometimes). I started cpap about 2.5months ago and it’s been miserable still. 

Im still miserable because even with the cpap I still wake up about 15-20 times a night from the cpap mask &amp; also from mouth breathing (which I didn’t really have an issue with before but I do now) I tried doing mouth taping + cpap, but There were about 3 instances where I thought I was literally going to die I choked so bad. So I stopped that. Before you say anything, yes I do have the humidity cranked up. 
Another thing is most nights the cpap makes me hyperventilate and it takes me about 2-3 hours to even fall asleep with it, burping with it on is difficult as well when I have a flare up from my stomach. 

I’m honestly not sure what my sleep apnea is caused by, it might not be my stomach issues, but I feel like there’s a chance that it is because even during the day if I don’t burp constantly it gets held up and feels like it’s choking me (the bloating/indigestion). 
I’m going to a ENT doctor to kind of weigh out my options since the sleep apnea place pretty much just told me “the only thing it could be is your tongue, nothing else you can do stay on the cpap. “

SleepApnea,"Newly diagnosed from home test, the nurse practitioner said it is obstructive sleep apnea and am waiting for a machine.

But - am realizing I want a lab test done, not just home test. But the NP said insurance will be all “this is good enough, no.”

A couple reasons: one, i would really like to definitively rule out any central apnea before starting treatment. Some factors make me think it’s a possibility (my breathing is habitually shallow; am not overweight, breathe through my nose; have high CO2 blood levels … it just subjectively feels like I “forget to breathe” sometimes…) If so is the treatment different?

Second, it sounds like, in a lab test they figure out the optimal pressure settings etc in lab, without that instead they have the home machine use default settings and go through the first night(s) collecting data on you and work from that - I’d rather start with appropriate settings in the first place. 

Especially since I’m concerned about the presence of central apnea. I’d want to know if I have it, before starting treatment muddies the waters (as CPAP itself can induce central apnea)

Third - I just want the data, because you don’t know what you don’t know - it seems safer and wiser - more data is better if you can get it

SleepApnea,"Hi, I was just wondering if anyone has any advice or had similar situations. I have moderate sleep apnea and got a CPAP in July. I have a resmed and at first had issues because the pressure was too low. After they upped the minimum pressure it helped a ton but I continued to have problems keeping the mask on. I tried all the variations of nasal pillows resmed / my supplier had since they told me full face masks are a last resort. 

I have an N20 mask now but I keep taking it off. All of the masks I seem to start to struggle to breathe in the middle of the night and rip them off. I don’t breath through my mouth. Either this or I am taking them off half awake because is so uncomfortable. 

With only being able to try new masks ever few months and not being able to try them on before getting them, combined with the months between appts with the sleep doctor/to get pressure adjustments, I’m at a loss of what else to try here. 

I don’t think I’ll meet compliance again and I doubt the insurance company will give me anther chance. 

I may just pay for it out of pocket though because even though its miserable to wear the cpap does help on the nights I use it.

SleepApnea,"I mention this in the title, because my observation here after 6 months of CPAP use is very specific to people who have a menstrual cycle:

I have noticed after 6 months of CPAP use that my quality of sleep, and my success with CPAP, varies depending on where I am in my cycle. For instance, on the first night or two after my period starts, I have a lot of trouble sleeping with the CPAP mask on my face, and I really just want to rip the mask off of my face and sleep without it. A night or two ago, I did exactly that, while I was asleep. After about an hour or so, my husband woke me up to inform me that I was sleeping without my CPAP, and that I was snoring. I thanked him and reattached the CPAP mask to my face.

Also, at this time of the month, I toss and turn all night.

The rest of the month, I am perfectly fine wearing the mask while I sleep.

My machine has started blowing really hard, like at a 20 and waking me up (I only have mild obstructive sleep apnea so this shouldn't be happening). It won't stop until I turn it off, even when I try taking deep breaths fully awake. It's supposed to auto adjust but it's not working. Also even with humidity down to 2 and the tank full at night I'm waking up with water in my mask and the tank is empty in the morning.
The mask is too big even though I gave my measurements at the consultation and the straps have to dig into my face to keep the air from leaking out of the Nasal pillow. So I wake up a lot at night because of the pain and in the morning I get a migraine.

SleepApnea,"I feel like I am going to scream. I had trouble (inconsistent airflow, machine not recording/saving usage statistics, etc.) with my CPAP machine, a Resvent iBreeze, that I've had for probably around 70 days. I spoke to the CPAP machine vendor and, after some back and forth, they eventually agreed to replace it with a different machine, the ResMed Airsense 11. I'm sending the old machine back to the vendor.

I called the vendor today to ask how compliance will work with the new machine. The representative I spoke to said that my new machine does not start a new 90-day compliance period, and that compliance for the new machine depends upon how much I used the old machine (note: this makes zero sense to me). So in other words, I have a little less than a month left to determine whether I get to keep my new machine or not. I then called my insurance company and was told the exact opposite: That compliance is based on the machine that I have, and so a new machine means a whole new 90-day compliance period. (This makes much more sense.)

Has anyone been in this situation before? I have had endless problems with the CPAP vendor, and it feels like every time I call them I get a different answer.

I have been pushing as hard as I can to get this red taped paperwork done as quickly as possible but I guess I am looking for input, hope, help, something.

I hardly sleep because it’s not the snoring that keeps me awake but when he stops breathing, so I help him adjust to breathe again. It is exhausting. We have children. He is trying to get a job. This is incredibly problematic and I am trying to do my best but reaching a point of I have no clue what to do anymore.

SleepApnea,"Early 20s here. I had DJS a year ago and honestly it didn't help my OSA. I had and still have a lot of issues with nasal breathing that seem to be tied to allergies and inflammation. I had a septoplasty and turbinate reduction done at the same time as my DJS. The only structure that could be affecting my nasal breathing are my adenoids afaik. The only weird thing is that nasal sprays haven't really helped with this, and almost all the doctors I've seen say my adenoids look fine...



I had to take a break from college last year because of DJS, and I thought I'd be getting good sleep and be functional this year. It seems like something is triggering my breathing to be a lot worse now though. If my breathing doesn't improve before the end of winter break, IDK how I would be able to function during the Spring semester. I don't even really like my major either.

If I didn't have so many health issues, I'd honestly just finish the program and figure out what I really wanna do in my spare time.

SleepApnea,"
I’ve had EXTREME fatigue and brain fog for a few years now and only recently began to suspect its sleep apnea. Doctors have been suggesting it’s all in my head/it’s something that will pass with time. I have sinus issues as well so it makes sense for this to be the problem. 

I’ve had bad experiences with doctors over the years. They don’t listen and don’t take your word when you think somethings wrong with your body. 

Where do I start with getting a CPAP? Do I need a doctors order to obtain one or can I just buy one? 

From what I’ve read I should go get a sleep study done and then get a CPAP but I don’t want to wait any longer. I’ve been living with this hell for years and I want to jump straight into a CPAP machine. Or is that not the best idea?

SleepApnea,"Hello

I recently had a sleep study and the results were sent to me by post a few weeks later. The recommendations in the results were not particularly useful to interpret the actual results themselves (lose weight/see an ENT). Perhaps seeing the ENT might be a good way to go though.

Could you help me interpret these? They don't seem severe but what sorts of solutions are possible?

I am ruling out losing weight because I am 86kg and I have a six pack so I don't have much to lose lol. Further, F1 drivers, American football and rugby players etc. all have large necks and they can't simply ""lose weight. It feels like a generalised and lazy recommendation. 

Anyway, how would you interpret my results and do you see particular courses of action that are appropriate?

Or should I just go to the ear, nose, and throat doctor and do a further study/analysis with them?

I’ve been very overweight for a long time which probably hadn’t helped my sleep but the surgery has meant I’ve lost an immediate 25kg.

Since I’ve come home from hospital I’ve noticed my AHI has been significantly lower (around 0.2 -  0.4) and last night (2months after surgery) was 0.0.

Has anyone else seen similar results?
Am I likely to see 0.0 again or is it probably just a fluke?",t2_4vn8ihco,0,"Zero AHI last night, can I repeat this?",[],r/SleepApnea,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.SleepApnea,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qs1d,,zveio5,True,aussierugbygirl,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/SleepApnea/comments/zveio5/zero_ahi_last_night_can_i_repeat_this/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/zveio5/zero_ahi_last_night_can_i_repeat_this/,33955,1672027240,0,,False,1672027252,1672027252,2022-12-26 04:00:40,,,,,,,

SleepApnea,"I have been using my AirCurve 10 VAuto for about a month now and haven't had any good results in terms of being under 3-5 AHI. My current AHI last night was at 21.98 which is not good. I was prescribed to have my machine be at 12 inhale and 16 exhale (12/16). From looking at OSCAR and the readings, it seems that some nights I am okay starting off in the night but then later on in the night I start to not breathe due to OA's happening or it happens early on in the night and vice versa. I used to be sub 13 AHI but now I am regularly in the 20's and have noticed that my drowsiness levels during the day have been increasing as in I am feeling more tired and drowsy. And it is much harder to get up during the morning.   


So far, I have tried different pillows by switching from my memory foam pillow to this very flat one but that did not seem to work. I have also tried turning up the humidifier in the machine but that didn't seem to do anything either (I knew it probably wasn't going to do a thing since it just changes the amount of moisture but worth a try.). I called the doctor a week ago who told me to bump up the pressure of my inhale from 11 to 12 but that hasn't done jack squat. I also go a new mask like 4 days ago due to the original mask not having a good seal and being really uncomfortable. I really like my F20 mask and it feels so much better compared to the Amara View mask. Overall, I am kind of frustrated with the way treatment has been going since starting with a new mask and hope someone can help me figure out if there is something wrong with the settings or something.  


[Pictures of OSCAR readings and stats.](https://imgur.com/a/ao3U5gt)  


I know I should consult with my doctor but all they did was change the inhalation level from 11 to 12 which is clearly not working. Plus if I wanted to see the actual doctor it would take weeks since the sleep center where I live is always full!

SleepApnea,"My main questions:
Do people with sleep apnea experience what could be called hypersomnia episodes? What kind of symptoms do they experience *during these episodes* besides hypersomnolence? How often do these kind of episodes occur? How severe is an individual’s sleep apnea to reach the point of developing hypersomnia *episodes*? How long do these episodes last?

Why I’m asking:
I posted the other day (while very confused) and then got a call back from the sleep clinic saying they were referring me to a different specialist for suspected KLS. I already have a sleep apnea diagnosis but according to my sleep DNP and the pulmonologist, it doesn’t seem likely that sleep apnea is causing the issue I’m trying to get help for. Like obviously the rational thing to do is still address the sleep apnea, but that’s not what I want to focus on in this post.

I’ve tried to look up the topic of hypersomnia episodes &amp; sleep apnea and don’t find much info. The DNP initially tried to tell me that my sleep apnea could be causing it, until they fully understood the details of my episodes &amp; associated symptoms. I mentioned the referral news to an RN relative tonight and they immediately started digging into the sleep apnea narrative, yet they know nothing about KLS.

SleepApnea,"I have very mild apnea - 5.1 on the scale that you need at least 5 to be clinically diagnosed. It's not nothing, obviously, and I snore pretty badly, but I've never felt chronically tired or that I wasn't sleeping well before. Did the study just because my snoring was annoying my wife.

That said, I've had an autopap for a couple months and I sleep like absolute shit compared to previously. It takes forever to fall asleep, and I wake up regularly and again have trouble falling back to sleep. I've had to take breaks from it several nights a week because I can't do my job on 4-5 hours of terrible sleep, which is what I'm typically managing with it.

My sleep doctor has come across as very single minded, insisting that I *need* to be using this. He claims I'll adjust, or that I can shave my beard and try a full face mask. He doesn't seem to think that being so sleep deprived that I'm worried about my job performance is that big of a deal.

SleepApnea,Last night I had a hard time falling asleep i eventually did once my eyes started to get heavy. I did wake up once in night but quickly went back to sleep without problem. I don't know if this is under central sleep apnea but i feel isn't the same because i realized i am still breathing and just suddenly i have to take a bigger breath. I have a pulse oximeter and when the episodes happen my blood oxygen levels stays normal above 95 but my heart rate would go up a bit. Normally when in bed my heart rate is in the 60s but when these episodes happened suddenly my heart rate would be in the 70s and lower 80s. For context i have been diagnosed with complex sleep apnea and have been on a bipap since the start of October. My bipap hasn't really picked up CSA in my sleep in a while and when does show up events would be below 5 normally 3.8 events throughout the sleep. OSA is almost non-existing at this point. Hell i was even told i don't snore anymore even on nights don't have the bipap on. Any idea what this is?

SleepApnea,"I've told my story on this sub and you've all been of tremendous help and support. Diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. Mainly hypopnea. Ahi of 71. Again, thank you for your support. 
I started cpap 14 weeks ago. But was only able to sleep with it for 2 weeks before sinusitis symptoms and severe headaches started. I had a CT and no sinusitis was seen. My symptoms were nasal pressure, under eye pain, eye pressure, headaches and a dry eye (feeling) and pressure above the eyebrow. Together with severe dizzyness and fatigue. This started after cpap use. And every time I stopped the cpap it went away. But came back after starting again. Eventually I stopped cpap all together. I had to. I couldn't even get out of bed without the help of my mom. I was so very dizzy. But the dizzyness and headaches stayed with me. In a milder form. So my search for answers began. 

I was told by 2 ENTS it's prob not my sinuses that causes the severe symptoms. But what they did see on the ct was a deviated septum. Because i have a hard time breathing trough my nose, I have become a mouth breather. I breathe trough my mouth most of the time.
My right nostril closes completely during the night and since I have severe sleep apnea and slept with a nasal mask that can be a problem. I can't sleep with a full face mask because op epilepsy. So that's not an option for me. Neurologist advises against that.

I saw another ENT today and she said they can perform a celon procedure. I think it's to reduce my turbinates. Something i should not get, according to ppl on this sub. Cause there's a risk of empty nose syndrome.

I really don't want them messing with my turbinates. So I was pretty surprised they came up with that as a solution to be able to breathe trough my nose again. I mean, my deviated septum is the problem, I don't have a cold or runny nose. The opposite even. She didn't even mention that my turbinates are inflamed. I do always have a very dry feeling in that right nostril. It always feels so dry.

Am I correct that a deviated septum surgery doesn't include the turbinates surgery? I don't want them messing with them. I just don't understand how treating the turbinates can help with better nasal airflow when there's a deviation?

I feel like they don't know what they're doing. I don't have a chronic cold or runny nose. I have a deviated septum that I want to have fixed. Is that possible without them messing with the turbinates?

Maybe this is not the right sub.

I had 2 sleep studies done at California Sleep Studies, the most recent being in October. My AHI is 99 without BIPAP. I saw my doctor the week I got my results, she was very helpful and put the request for BIPAP in right away. She said it would take about a month. So I waited a month and a week, and then called again. I explained my high AHI to the nurse and she switched my referral from routine to urgent and told me to wait another month. So I did. I called the referral office and they did some poking around and discovered that California Sleep Solutions-who I also went to for my sleep study- isn't accepting my insurance anymore. So they have to send it somewhere else. But she was transparent and explained that there was a shortage, and Nivano Physicians is having a hard time getting CPAP, etc. through Anthem Medi-Cal. So it might be a while.

I've heard it can take a while. I just wanted to stay optimistic. I'm so fucking tired, the brain fog is crazy.

SleepApnea,"I just got a sleep apnea oral device for moderate sleep apnea and would love to get others’ thoughts before I get too upset about my short-lived experience thus far. 

As background, I never “noticed” any breathing issues prior to a sleep study I did for insomnia, other than people telling me I snore. My problem has always been being unable to stay asleep. I wake up 3-4x a night, fully awake. I have no issues initially falling asleep and staying asleep for the first 2-3 hours. I’m 35, very fit, eat healthy, but have a high stress career. 

I’ve only worn the appliance for two nights now and I can only wear it for half the night. It makes my teeth and jaw noticeably hurt, and I could even taste a slight tinge of blood after taking it out at the lovely hour of 3 am. Yesterday morning I felt grumpier and groggier than I’ve ever experienced from my typical insomniac wake ups. Like completely braindead and the tiniest thing filled me with irrational rage. It was like Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde bad.

My throat was also very sore and I had a headache (which I don’t normally get). This device is so bulky I can’t even fully close my lips over it so I’d imagine I was mouth breathing quite a bit. 

Is there a break-in period or adjustment phase I need to stick out? The fact that it causes such irritation is making me dread sleep and triggering my anxiety, which obviously does not help with the whole insomnia situation. I’m also worried about how this could damage my teeth - two of them have very shallow roots and this device seems pretty harsh.

SleepApnea,"I’m a 31 year old male who had never heard of sleep apnea. Up until I had dental surgery and was put under. The oral surgeon was having troubles with my air way closing multiple times. He recommended me to get tested for sleep apnea.

About two weeks later I go for a sleep consultation and get a home test device and fill out a questionnaire. A few weeks later a follow up with my results of a score of 28 ahi.

Dr referral and sleep study referral sent to insurance company and bouncing that back and forth for a month to get my coverage for a cpap.

Did some research to familiarize myself with the equipment out there and how it operates.
Took home a Resmed airsense 10 auto set. Along with a air fit f20 face mask and heated tube. I wasn’t able to overcome the pressures with the nasal masks at minimum pressure. Felt like pushing against a brick wall with my nose.

Before my therapy I would suffer from killer headaches after my work week was over. The kind that wouldn’t go away after being up for awhile or taking tynol . I’d have to try to sleep it off. Often most of the day would be slept away. Often I would feel constantly tired and would sometimes take nap. No motivation for usual activities.

Heartburn or acid reflux was a weekly occurrence and often disturbed my sleep. Taking tablets multiple times per night. It was very uncomfortable at times.

At this time I’ve been in my treatment for only a month. My ahi has gone from 28 to 5. The difference is noticeable in my case. Waking up feeling rested. No more headaches and heartburn (thank God) and a notable difference in energy.

The adjustment of pressure has been a challenge.
Second week in I had a night where I swallowed a bunch of air and gas painfully bloated. Mouth being dry in the middle of the night due to a low humidity level. Mask sealing hasn’t been an issue with exception to an occasional jet stream of pin air into my eyeball.

SleepApnea,"Just wondering how people have fared with this device? How long did it take to get used to it? Did you find it helped?

I have mild apnea and don't want to use the machine, this was suggested as a reasonable alternative. 

First impressions are it is quite uncomfortable as one has to adjust their breathing pattern. You're exhaling out for quite a lot longer than you're inhaling.

The backwards pressure does not feel significant, it's hard to believe it keeps the airway open but there are a few studies confirming it's the case and it got FDA approval.

I would imagine it increases the CO2 levels in the body as a lot of that air you're attempting to exhale is being recirculated back in.

SleepApnea,"I originally suspected I may have sleep apnea because I have a \*very\* hard time getting out of bed, and pretty much any modification of my 9 to 10 sleep hours is detrimental to my energy levels and mental health. .. and still sleeping 10 hours I get the feeling I build up tension while sleeping and have overall low energy.

The sleep lab I took was the home one (the formal expensive FDA approved equipment), and  the questions that I have are....

a.) Can OSA at this level  interfere with the production of hormones, and neurotransmitters significantly? 

b.) The sleep study recommends the mandibular apparatus, or cpac.. but if its cpap then I should do a in side a clinic study. Why?    

c.) I was found ""7 obstructive apenas, 18 central apenas, and 2 mixed apeneas "" I thought the mandibular apparatus wasnt efficient in central apenas?

SleepApnea,"I posted this in r/CPAP but got no replies as of yet. I have been using CPAP every night for 3+ months now without success. No matter what I try I still can't use it for a full night consistently.

My pressure range is 4-9cm with EPR 3. I must be one of the rare people who actually find 4cm to be an adequate amount of air, anything higher than 6 is too much for me. The data doesn't ever show my CPAP going above 8cm. I haven't had a professional titration yet, but so far the pressure range seems to be working. In all my CPAP data my pressure remains at 4 and I usually have an AHI under 2. Yet I have only successfully used the CPAP from sleep onset to wakeup maybe five times now. Every other time I wake up with the mask off and don't remember taking it off. Some night I use it 3 hours, other nights I seem to have taken the mask off after an hour which is very frustrating. Average usage is about 2 hours.I have practiced falling asleep with the mask on and at this point I feel very comfortable using the CPAP when I'm awake. I don't know why I take it off.

SleepApnea,"There is a lot of evidence of a phenotype of sleep apnea not necessarily due to obstruction but due to a comparatively low arousal threshold which causes early termination of breathing. This study (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4315811/)

-	AHI &lt; 30
-	Oxygen saturation level &gt; 82.5%
-	Hypopnea % &gt; 58.3%
This phenotype is shown to predict failure in using a mandibular advancement device and significantly greater failure with CPAP.

SleepApnea,"Hi there, TIA - it's a bit verbose but this is important to me and I wanted to give some context before my questions.

**Context:**

I've been having poor memory, constant day-time fatigue, dry mouth \[daily, even after 1-2 hrs sleep) etc. The dry mouth has been ongoing since \~2010. Fatigue has been multi-factorial, but has also existed for &gt;10 yrs.  


I'm finally getting my turbinate reduction \[**significant** hypertrophy of inferior and middle turbinates, concha bullosa\], with a 'mild' septal deviation \[it is quite visible, but not a huge concern for him\] was the diagnosis from the ENT, luckily through the public healthcare system \[New Zealander\]. I / We wanted to do the full nose surgery, but I have a bleeding disorder so he preferred to do the turbinate reduction and then reassess after that. 

I have read that hypertrophy of turbinates itself is a cause of OSA. I'm now 152lb (28M, 5'10), used to snore a bit when I was 30-35lb heavier.

My Galaxy Watch 5 Pro \[unreliable but worth mentioning\] over the past 4 mo's has my O2 hitting the 70's 1-2\* a week, and the 80's almost daily for parts of the night.

The WellUe 02 ring was in the 80's, but I've been wearing some strapping \[' **Neoprene Anti Snore Stop Snoring Chin Strap Belt'\]** since I got the 02 ring about 2 weeks ago, that strapping has halved my day-time fatigue, dry-mouth and memory issues, as well as increasing my 02 scores \[fewer drops, and not dipping below 90 anymore\].

&amp;#x200B;

**Question 1)** 

I compete in Table Tennis at quite a high level, but my HR is in the 150-185 range when playing at a very dialed back physical intensity \[If I make any effort, I'm too tired\]. My resting heart rate is in the mid 50's, and I'm in quite good shape. There players who are 240lb and old move less laboured than I do, unfortunately. When I'm walking my HR is 115-130, a light jog has me at 160 almost immediately, and it settles around 180-185. My Max is 200\~.   


**Q2)** I've hired a Resmed for a week ($20USD!), to trial, and will obviously demand they take my money in purchasing one, if it works to address my day-to-day fatigue  (work, general life, functioning). 

However, given an injury I've sustained, its hard for me to test my sports anytime soon, which is a close #2 priority. I just want to temper my expectations and hence am asking if anyone's experienced reversability in much-poorer than expected athletic performance from addressing their OSA.

SleepApnea,"After a long day’s work, all you want to do is get a sound sleep that allows your body to rejuvenate and rest. However, with **sleep apnea**, this seems to be impossible. This condition is a sleep disorder characterized by **pauses in breathing or periods of shallow breathing during sleep**. The pauses can occur frequently throughout the night and **last for a few seconds or a few minutes**. This occurs as a result of **excessive carbon dioxide accumulated in the bloodstream**.

Some **risk factors of sleep apnea** are being **overweight, substance abuse, sinus problems, allergies, nasal congestion, and other medical conditions**. Now that we have the basic information about the condition, let's identify the common symptoms required for diagnosis. 

**Signs** include-

* Irregular breathing 
* Loud snoring
* Lack of attention
* Waking up with a dry mouth 
* Gasping for air during sleep 
* Morning headaches
* Insomnia 
* Hypersomnia
* Choking
* Vision problems
* Excessive daytime sleepiness

In some cases, such symptoms may **result in accidents and even death due to the irregular oxygen supply to the body and brain**. In addition to this, there are **different types of sleep apnea**, including-

* **Obstructive** sleep apnea: It occurs when muscles in the back of the throat relax.
* **Central** sleep apnea: It occurs when the brain is unable to transmit signals to breathing muscles.
* **Mixed** sleep apnea: A combination of both obstructive and central sleep apnea. 

**Coping** with this condition involves a combination of **therapy/surgery and lifestyle changes**. **Therapy** can be facilitated by the use of **oral appliances, adaptive servo-ventilation, airway devices, and supplemental oxygen**. However, for severe cases, **surgery** involving **tissue removal, jaw repositioning, implants, and nerve stimulation** may be recommended. 

For therapy or surgery to show long-term benefits, certain **lifestyle changes** need to be incorporated.

I want to buy a machine but dont know if i should buy cpap or bpap also dont know what mask to buy. also please give me tips on how to manage this problem. I never feel like I sleep. I just wake up tired and feel like i just ran a marathon because my blood pressure and heart rate are fast from the time i get up. At school I see everyone studying no problem and i am the one falling asleep in class. Also i have seen a decrease in my eyesight in these 2 years. I dont know how i got it but its not good. I have also passed out and fainted in gym class 2 times and the school called an ambulance and i was sent home no problem. I feel like people and my friends have abandoned me.

SleepApnea,"Hi.

I have a poor sleep. I did a test at the hospital last year but the condition were so poorly managed I barely scraped the 5h of required sleep. They registered 13 hypopnoea in total and nothing else.

My husband got me a sort of connected detector to monitor my nights that has been reviewed and approved by the hospital in question. It shows I have 4 apneas by hours on best nights, 3 times outta 7, the rest is around 10 up to 20 apneas.

So I did another professional test, with a sleep apnea specialist, at home this time. It showed 4 apnea but 27 hypopnoea. My oxygen went below 95 but never under 90 several times.

The doctor has concluded then my sleep is ok. He did noted I snored more than 50% of the night up to 90dcbl which is super super loud.

So no real apnea, a lot of hypopnoea but it seems harmless? Altho it shows I wake up around 9 times per hour. The doctor did noted I have a mucromandibula, my jaw is way too small and my tongue is too large, also my mouth roof is narrow and high, I show every anatomical signs of apnea risks. I also often wake up gasping for air.

I don't know what to do cuz the detector I have at home does say some nights are rather ok but most are not so good to really bad. But I can't get tested till it shows up in the doctors records can't I?

Is someone is a situation similar to mine? Any insights or advice?

SleepApnea,"Does anyone know if there are any downsides to just buying a CPAP?

I am very sure I have sleep apnea and the boil-and-bite mouthguard I have doesn’t seem to alleviate it much. I was planning on getting a custom fit mouth guard, but if this store bought one doesn’t seem to do anything, I doubt the custom one will be that much better.

However, I found many websites that let you buy a CPAP as long as you buy the mask separately. (It’s a loophole where you don’t need a prescription to buy “replacement parts”.)

My question is, is there any downside to just buying one instead of waiting for a sleep study?

My concern is not cost, but time. I’m feeling terrible and as a software engineer it is affecting my job. I can’t wait over 2 months to get a sleep study scheduled (which is the soonest I can get). I NEED relief ASAP, whatever the cost.

SleepApnea,"I'm know I'm probably way jumping the gun, but I'm really just...looking for some support, or I suppose making sure at least I don't further disappoint myself.

I'm literally lying in bed in a sleep study at 4:30 am. I thought for sure this was *the* source of my remaining health problems and I was so looking forward to moving on to this step in the diagnostic process, even though I knew how basically torturous sleeping in an unfamiliar bed on a bad part of town was going to be for my particular set of health issues. This was going to be life changing!

Before I fell asleep, the tech explained that the night would be in two parts; the first diagnostic, and as long as in the first part I slept enough and had enough apnea, in the second part she'd wake me to try a CPAP.

Other than when I'd wake up gasping for air, I thought I'd stayed asleep all night. But I did finally wake and grab my phone to turn off the space heater in the room...and found it was 4:15, and this thing is supposed to end at 5:15, and I am suspicioisly missing any CPAP on my face.

Is this it? Does this mean sleep apnea **definitely** isn't my issue and its back to the diagnostic drawing board? I and my doctors were so sure...I'm honestly feeling so discouraged...

I figured maybe I could reach out to those with experience here to get an idea on the possibilities/probabilities, instead of potentially mope several weeks or more while waiting to hear back on results from doctors over the holidays.  

To be clear, I don't expect a definitive diagnosis from Reddit. Just curious if anyone else competed a sleep study that was supposed to be in two parts, did *not* get a CPAP in the second part, but was still diagnosed with sleep apnea later...or if not getting the CPAP means it's probably a forgone conclusion.

Thank you all so much! For what it's worth, reading and lurking here helped give me the courage and patience to keep pushing forward on getting this checked out.

SleepApnea,"Hello all,

Thought I would share my recent experience as maybe someone can relate ? 

My name is John and i’m 29yo and have severe sleep apnea 

On the 14/12/22 I went in for the following surgeries:

SEPTOPLASTY + INFERIOR TURBINOPLASTIES
MODIFIED UPPP +
LINGUAL TONSILLECTOMY

i arrived at the hospital did a covid test some paper work and got changed into a gown 

A few hours later I was ready for the surgery.I remember getting wheeled into the theatre talking to the drs then just like that i was out!

2.5 hours later i wake up my nose packed my throat is killing me! on a drip spent the night etc

Next morning my mum picks me up and instead of going home I insisted we go to the shops as I wanted to pack the fridge with Powerade,icypoles &amp; purée lol 

Did my shopping and boom blood came gashing out and here i am running to the public toilet a bandage holding up my nose blood pouring out!
I sat on the floor of the toilet and a few clots came out and a heavy stream of blood!Eventually it stopped and i went home thinking maybe it’s normal to bleed just once….

boy was I wrong! I got home an hour later blood came out again and even more clots and this time was even worse apparently a tonsillectomy haemorrhage had occurred,we called the ambulance and off to the nearest hospital i went they tried to put me on a drip but i had no veins apparently just valves.

i went into a room with all drs looking at me and then it started again dr spray my nose and mouth with numb stuff and stuck a big fork in my mouth and started to suck and pull out clot after clot after clot blood all over me over the dr face on the floor was terrible 

eventually they wheeled me off to theatre where i remember they put the gas mask on and one dr held my throat with his hand 🤚 They operated again for several hours.

the next 2.5 days i stayed in hospital on all types of tablets can hardly swallow other patients going off there heads I begged and cried to go home as i couldn’t cope with these mad people 

i’m at home now since 17/12/22 and my throat hurts like anything i taste my own flesh all day everyday it’s disgusting 🤢 my hair hurts yes my HAIR hurts i have constant migraines,my nose is completely blocked the packing is out but i still can’t breathe through it at all,my teeth are killing me,my breath is a disaster,I sleep a lot but still very tired

So just wondering if the cpap machine helped you right away or take a while? 

I had a bad nose surgery that really made my sleep apnea way worse, I recently just got a corrective surgery to hopefully resolve the issue. I’m getting discouraged with the machine though because I am still waking up so much throughout the night and was really hoping the sleep would at least be a little better with the machine. I’m not sure if it’s because my left nostril is still mostly closed and that’s why it’s not helping as much as I’d hope.

SleepApnea,"Hi all,

(22M) Recently been diagnosed by UARS, partially due to nocturnal nasal congestion and partially due to a slightly narrow retropalatal and retroglossal airway. 

I am not considering PAP therapy for a few reasons. I do not qualify for it because my AHI is too low (high RDI), it doesn’t solve the nasal congestion issue, and since I am young, I’d like to just permanently cure it. 

I have been diagnosed via CBCT for skeletal class III and dental class I, with ~5mm of moderate AP/sagittal maxillary deficiency and ~3mm of mild transverse maxillary deficiency. 

I was considering MSE + forward protraction, because it seems to solve the root issue, which is my deficient maxilla, without resorting to invasive MMA surgery. It also anatomically guarantees improvement of nasal breathing. Although the forward protraction aspect is not that effective on paper, I believe I can achieve a good couple of mm of forward movement of the maxilla because I am highly motivated and will use it as much as possible. 

However, another route to take is ENT surgeries. The CBCT also showed a slight deviated septum and slightly enlarged turbinates. Sinuses are fine.

Both routes have the same end goal, but I am leaning toward MSE + forward protraction because it seems to address the root skeletal issue while avoiding risks of ENS, and it also solves some TMD pain I’ve been having as a result of my class III. However, the failure rate of MSE in adult males is rather high, there is potential for asymmetry, and the process is much more drawn out. Therefore I am not ruling out the possibility of ENT surgery.

What do you all think is the right course of action from here on out?

SleepApnea,"just got my new CPAP machine from on Friday. I am having a few problems with it that I’m hoping to get some help with how to fix. The main thing is that the 2 nights I’ve had it, after a few hours, the tubes get filled with water and make a gurgling sound every time I inhale. I googled it and it said to keep the machine below head level, which I do and it doesn’t help. It also suggests it’s from the tubes being too cold but my problem is that I hated the feeling of breathing in warm air, so I wanted it to be cooler. Is there anyway to get around that without having to make the air be warm? Additionally, I’m having trouble with the comfort/fit of the mask itself. The air blowing it i my nose makes it hard to exhale through my nose, which kind of makes me feel like it’s hard to breathe. Also when I move at night trying to get comfortable, it’s difficult to lay on my side and have the mask on my nostrils correctly. It gets smooshed between my head and the pillow and so it goes sideways and I have to mess with it a lot to get it straight. Any ways to get around these problems?

SleepApnea,"After a few years of wondering, my husband was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and started using a CPAP machine about a month ago. He grumbled at first but is adjusting to it well, and hasn't missed a night. He doesn't feel much difference in terms of feeling better rested so far, but to me he seems a bit more alert and looks a bit less tired. He also is far less restless while sleeping. 

He's going in for a follow up with the sleep clinic today, and we need to make some decisions. We live in South Korea and we are renting a CPAP machine through the clinic (a Philips). With Korean national insurance it ends up being about $40 USD a month. However, we're moving to the Netherlands in 2 weeks. We know next to nothing about the medical system in NL, though internet research reveals that things probably move a lot slower (relatively) and things are less accessible. I did find that it should be fully covered in NL though.

We have to decide whether to keep renting it even after leaving Korea (will cost more like $80 a month, though, as we'll lose Korean national insurance), buy the device outright (about $1000 maybe?) or just bring his diagnosis paperwork and start fresh there. 

Starting fresh would probably be the easiest, though I hate to have the interruption, and worry about how long it would take to get set up there. Is anyone here in the Netherlands who knows much about this?

I'm also unsure whether bringing the machine from South Korea to NL would reduce the lifespan of the machine, due to the voltage difference. Are CPAP machines like computers and can adapt to different power levels with the right plug adapter? Or will the voltage difference create a problem? I don't want to haul something that will become an expensive paperweight to the Netherlands.

SleepApnea,"Long story short I went for my sleep apnea appointment (got my diagnosis btw, and it is confirmed by the test results). I got checked in, they hooked me up to the sleep reader machine thing (you know, the box with all the wires and all the brain scan electrodes, and bla bla bla) and so it was pretty ok. Nothing went wrong up to this point. The guy hooking me up wasn't mean. No one cared that I wanted to sleep with the light on. They make you sleep on your back. (You're not a loud to turn over etc, because that's ""part of the test"" I was told.) This was not a problem at first, because I didn't care.

You're basically hooked up with these wires, and if you move too much they come off, and then someone has to come in and re-hook you up. You're laying on a bed in the middle of a room with cameras staring straight at you. There's a breathing apparatus, depending on how it goes. They monitor everything, your brainwaves, your breathing, your pee (yes there's a pee test). I sware to god.

And my first thought before the test, I was like ""Cool... I have nothing to hide. I wanna know if I have this. Let's see."" Right?

Until I passed out... and the first time I woke up I realized I'm laying there flat on my back, in the spotlight, unable to move, on camera, all test proctor eyes on me, and I have a MASSIVE fucking boner I got in the middle of sleep sticking straight up poking obviously out of the sheets. I'm 8 inches btw. And not like in that ""I'm 8 inches"" kind of way that every 6 inch dude uses to try to impress his GF. I have proof.

My first thought was ""Omfg I don't care wtf fuck this shit I'm going back to bed."" Then I went back to sleep, and kept waking up, *with* a massive boner. It was not stopping.

I eventually woke up at like 2AM and did not go back to sleep for about 15-20 minutes. I was just lying there completely still staring at the ceiling with a boner I didn't want sticking straight up on camera. There was nothing to do. There was no way to hide it, and I'm sure if they were watching they had already saw and laughed before I woke up.

Eventually I went back to sleep, woke up and left as the test was over.

SleepApnea,"Background: I’ve always had bad sleep from childhood through my 30s. Several times it was suggested to my parents as a youngster that I have a sleep study. Well I got 2 this year. In the lab and at home. 

The data comes back and I have very low numbers 1.7 API per hour. (Forgive me if I’m not saying that correctly). 

Now bc I have had diagnosed A-fib since I was 11 the cardiologist pushed for CPAP prescription and contacted my sleep Dr. We got one but I ended up having to pay out of pocket for a resmed 11 as my API was too low. All fine and dandy. 

Current events: 
My resmed is recording Central APIs of 5.0 per hour and zero obstructive events. I contact my sleep Dr who tells me “correct your brain is failing to tell your lungs to breath between sleep phases.” He stated that this is what they saw on the study. I called the DME who says I should be on a BiPAP.

Overall I’ve been physically sick nauseous, dizzy, confused and with daily migraines since starting my CPAP. I’m sleeping about 2hr 45min a night in two sessions.

Questions:
1) have y’all experienced a severe level of exhaustion from such low central API numbers? 

2) Im currently out of pocket with cost which is doable for me - what strategies have helped y’all get your dr to move you to a bipap? They want me to stick to the CPAP for 90 days to gather data. I simply can’t function and some days am not safe to be driving due to my inability to think clearly.

I got a lot of blood tests done, gut health tests, and vision tests. All came back fine which made the doctor blame my symptoms on anxiety, however by this point I was anxious as much as concerned with how I was feeling.

SleepApnea,"This is a “what would you think/do” post. 

In my follow-up appointment to review the results of my at-home sleep study, my doctor started by asking me questions like “So… was this normal for you? You felt fine the next morning? Are you sure you’re feeling fine?” - basically it threw me off guard because it felt like she was wondering how I was still alive and talking to her. It was also unnerving because I’m thinking “what does it matter what I say, you have hard data in front of you - you should know the answers to your questions… so you tell me, how am I doing?”

“Well, you DON’T have sleep Apnea” she finally said. This wasn’t too surprising as I did the study to begin addressing my snoring and had no other symptoms that I can tell (I feel well rested, my partner hasn’t said that I gasp at all during sleep, etc.). She then said “I do have a reading here that I can’t make sense of. She said that there was one drop below 88% where it dipped to 77% for 45 minutes. She only had one hypothesis/explanation and that it must be the device itself of something I did in my sleep that affected the device. She said it’s probably a good idea to follow up with an in-lab study - which I will do. It is peak Holiday and vacation season and my doctor intimated that this will take months for me to get an appointment and complete.  

As for the results, I don’t think it is a problem with the device. I used it as prescribed. My partner has said to me on more than one occasion that sometimes I’m so quiet (when I’m not snoring) that she’s checked to see if I’m alive. I’ve also read that the at-home devices under-score severity of sleep problems. Given the amount of time I have to wait for a referral to a sleep specialist and an in-lab test, I bought a Wellue 02ring and wore it last night.

SleepApnea,"So I was told by an orthodontist I could go through the process of mma / double jaw surgery to advance my lower jaw, but was told it may not be enough to open my airway. I also had a sleep study done which showed I only had minor episodes, with them increasing when on my back.

Despite this, I feel like my neck and soft palate is choking me when sleeping on my back, and the same but lessened when awake. The only way to stop this feeling is pushing my lower jaw forward as far as I can.

So my questions are:

1. Should I bother seeing an oromaxillofacial surgeon for a consult? I saw an ortho first because omf consults near me are $200+. I will also see an ENT and hope they can help.

SleepApnea,"I've been tracking my sleep with a Withings Sleep analyser and that has been doing a good job at detailing my poor sleep, which has been for what feels like years. Recently everything seems to be getting worse, multiple night time wakings with dry mouth and exhausted. Despite spending over 8 hours in bed, my actual sleep time recently is averaging about 3.5 - 4 hours sleep per night. The sleep analyser says not enough Deep sleep and Rem , too much light sleep, and Sleep Apnea 'severe'  with 40-45 interruptions per hour.

I have a sleep study booked for next week , which can't come quick enough!.. as I'm sure all this adds up to a sleep apnea diagnosis and requires CPAP asap.

In the meantime I got myself an Oximeter.. I guess to verify what my withings app is telling me. The first night, last night, sure enough correlates with the data out of my withings app. I guess I was just surprised and actually a little alarmed to see it for real, with oxygen dipping to 80% saturation levels more than once. In fact all the time i was asleep it's not looking good (see screenshot)

I'm a 48yr old male, side sleeper. Non smoker , barely drink alcohol, &amp; have cut caffeine all together. Weight is ok , but enlarged tonsils. Hoping I can make some progress with a formal diagnosis and route to treatment as all I have so far is sleeping aid tablets from the doctor which I'm too scared to take in case it makes the apnea worse. And I'm exhausted and can't remember when I last woke up feeling refreshed.

SleepApnea,"Hi All,
I’m waiting to be seen by a specialist (you know how getting those appointments go), but I’m wondering if anyone has any insight.

I’ve suspected apnea for a while. I think back to when I was a kid and the comments from friends at sleepovers “idk if you were breathing” or my mom “I’d have to check to see if you were breathing at night”. It got pretty bad as an adult until I had my deviated septum and turbinates fixed, but now it’s back.

I’m 20 lbs lighter than when I had surgery, but still have weight to lose. I do have nasal allergies. I’ve experienced this issue with a normal, healthy BMI as well as my current not so great BMI.

SleepApnea,"Hi there

I’m very newly diagnosed with sleep apnea. I am currently overweight and trying to work on it. Doctor said that it might even be caused partly by the unnoticed sleep apnea, since I have regularly worked out (strenght training and long walks) for the last 4-5 years. 

The thing is, stuff with my breathing got worse when I was put on meds for my sleep. I’m also diagnosed with bipolar disorder and the same meds are part of the working combination that keeps me stable and not taking it is not an option. 

I’m not really sure what to do. I am going to put much more effort into my weight loss because right now it is all over the place (which is why the doc thought it might be caused my sleep apnea, my weight changes are up to 20lbs in a short anount of time) but honestly I’m not even sure what more I can do. 

I have pretty regular sleeping schedule, I try to eat healthy (but probably not enough of a caloric deficite), I work out 3-4 times a week, I don’t smoke and rarely drink.

SleepApnea,"Hi. I was diagnosed w OSA and saw an ortho who said I had a narrow airway and what appeared to be a deviated septum and said I should see an ENT.

Saw one, they said my right nostril was only slightly deviated but my nasal passageways on that side were narrow and a balloon sinusplasty would help and septoplasty wouldn't be necessary. They also said my airway wasn't too narrow which I find hard to believe considering how recessed my chin is. 

I guess my question is this - how worth it would it be to get a second opinion? After doing my research it seems most people here found little to no relief after the sinusplasty and I'm starting to feel like they just wanted to get their $$$ considering this was my first apt w them and they tried no other options, nor did they address my sleep apnea.

SleepApnea,"Basically, I have had sleep issues all my life. I suffered from insomnia since a child and have just have never been able to get much sleep. Recently I got diagnosed with sleep apnea, so apparently even the sleep I have been getting has be awful.

Obviously, living like this has been horrible. It's insane the amount of stress and anxiety I have felt basically my whole life. I have been barely functioning for years.

I am 25 years old now, I deeply regret not ever really seeking help until this year. But I'm not sure what to do at this point.

I feel like I am mentally retarded, life has felt like a dream for years. 

I got a CPAP and I have not been able to use it. I wake up after a few hours and then can't fall back asleep. I know everyone says to stick with it, but I just can't take any more nights of 3 - 4 hours of fragmented sleep. Because of the insomnia and anxiety I just don't think I will be able to use the CPAP.

It feels like I am stuck in this cycle of sleep apnea, insomnia, and constant anxiety and I don't know what to do. I have thought about checking myself into a mental hospital because I just can't function anymore, I'm scared to even drive.

SleepApnea,"I just got the results back from my sleep study, stating that I have mild sleep apnea with a score of around seven or eight.

But the doctor told me that it seems to be worse when I sleep on my side or on my front. Of course, all the advice that I can find online states that you should be sleeping on your side or front to help with sleep apnea. So I said that I thought that was weird, and the doctor agreed with me. I also mentioned that it feels harder to breathe when I lie on my back before going to sleep. The doctor said that the 'data doesn't lie' though, and advised me to try sleeping on my back anyway. She also said that it might help to lose some weight if possible, but acknowledged that that's easier said than done.

Although the phonecall felt positive whilst it was happening, it was brief and I don't feel that we went into the results and possible treatment options in enough depth. It also seems unusual that the apnea is better when I sleep on my back and I feel like that warrants further investigation into the potential cause.

Although she also acknowleged that losing weight is easier said than done, I am worried that her advice might becausr of institutional fatphobia. I know that there's evidence that losing weight can help with sleep apnea but I also know that there are other potential causes and that weight might not be the issue. I also might have PCOS (still need to arrange blood tests but ultrasound indicates that it's possible) and I have always struggled to maintain a lower weight than where I am right now. I have experienced medical fatphobia before and I worry that I'm being left to deal with it alone when there could be a different cause and other possibe solutions.

I'll take her advice for now but I am wondering whether I should call back and talk about my concerns further. Also, I have been using a nasal spray, which has been helping, but it's a steroid and I don't think I'm supposed to use it long-term but she didn't discuss it and I forgot to bring it up.

SleepApnea,"I figured this was asked before but after reading several posts I can't really find anything quite like this. 

My AHI on my sleep study was 5, 6 and 6. I have two small children which can definitely make for tired days, but most days I feel good. I don't fall asleep in public and pretty religiously track my sleep. As long as the kids aren't too crazy and I'm averaging 7 hours a night I feel great most days. I'm groggy in the mornings, but I've also been that way since I've been born. AFAIK I don't have any day to day consequences to fix with treatment. I understand there's an elevated risk for some diseases, this is something I need to learn more about. 

From my understanding I have about as mild a case of sleep apnea as possible. From what my doctor was saying it sounds like they don't treat if it's 5 events or lower and hour. So it feels like a rounding error away from not recommending treatment. 

Being that he has a doctorate and I don't I agreed to try the CPAP. My struggle is I'm really not sure what benefit I'm going to get out of this. I've heard lots of people say they felt like a new person, but that just doesn't seem possible to me. As I said before any general day I feel good and not tired. So outside unnatural amounts of energy I am not sure how this improves.

On the flip side you have all the drawbacks of the CPAP. On top of those, the first nights with my CPAP I couldn't make it past 4-5 hours. My doctor turned down the flow which made it to where I can now make it the whole night, but I feel awful when I wake up.

SleepApnea,"My first alarming event happened last May, when I woke up desperately gasping for air with my arms numb and overall terrified. I couldnt sleep on my back and have been sleeping on my side since.

PCP suggested sleep apnea could be the issue and referred me to a sleep lab for a home study. I had to wait around two months to get the device, use it and return it. Test came back negative but the sleep lab doctor did refer me for an actual overnight study in the sleep lab, again, had to wait two more months. 

I finally got the results yesterday and its mild sleep apnea with AHI of 8.4. Doctor went over the options such as weight loss (already been working on this but I had lost around 30lbs before I even had an actual occurence so I knew it would be a little complex than just losing weight although I will keep excercising) then the mouth guard but he did say its about 40% success and finally the APAP with a 96% success rate. I chose APAP and I am having a machine ordered. 

What can I expect in terms of improvement? Currently I am sore from sleeping on my side,  constantly tired with much difficulty getting out of bed most days, I do feel pretty anxious and stressed at work and sometimes out of work, and overall depressed. 

I understand the first two are the ones that might be directly linked but I hope that being rested will improve the latter.

SleepApnea,"(Let me preface this by saying that having the insurance and funds to see healthcare providers is fairly new to me and this tale does include situations where I overzealously jumped into thing, starryeyed at the promises I was given. I know know many of these decisions were ill informed and stupid.)

A few years ago, I was diagnosed w OSA by my PCP.

-they referred me to an ortho to get fitted for a mouthpiece to help me sleep better 

-ortho takes x-rays and says my airway is narrow and I appear to have a deviated septum and should also see an ENT (i have a very clearly recessed chin so i figured)

-ortho also says they can do braces which might move my jaw forward just enough to help me breathe better (obviously not accurate but again, I did not do my research) to avoid cpap or mouthpiece.

- i get the braces and we are now nearly 2 years in, I know now that their promise was highly unrealistic and also I know I am not breathing better.

- Oh well, I have met my deductible for the year so I see an ENT. 

- they say my anatomy is not set up well (duh) and the nasal passages on my right side are very narrow. They also say while I do have a deviated septum, it's ""very minor"" and that a balloon sinusplasty would help me breathe/sleep about 70% better which is enough for some people. 

Now for my thoughts -  I did schedule the balloon sinusplasty but after further research, I don't see how this would be effective for me at all. I don't have recurrent sinusitis, just a general issue of mouth breathing and difficulty nose breathing. I also found reviews of people stating they try to sell this procedure to every patient and to seek a second opinion. 

It also doesn't appear this procedure is ever done for OSA, and I have not seen anyone here state this as a solution. 

My question - At this point... a second opinion from WHO? Another ENT? Some sort of surgeon to review options? A sleep doctor (hard to find in my area). I just feel so thrown around and incredibly stupid about putting all of my faith in many medical places that in retrospect seem more out to make a quick buck.

SleepApnea,"Hi all,

New to this sub and to the world of sleep apnea. My almost 6 year old daughter needs some dental work and during the treatment discussion the dentist noted that she suspects she may have sleep apnea. We have an appointment tomorrow with her GP and we’ll hopefully get a referral to an ENT to asses her tonsils (which are absolutely huge even when she’s healthy) and get a medical opinion on if it’s sleep apnea or not. Does anyone have advice on questions I should be asking the ENT? 

A few symptoms of why sleep apnea is suspected:
- very large tonsils, small airway
- wakes multiple times a night (always has)
- snoring 
- generally noisy sleep in different ways 
- teeth grinding
- sleeping with her mouth open

She’s never had behavioral issues or issues falling asleep during the day, she’s never been a bed wetter, etc. so maybe it’s not sleep apnea but I’m preparing myself for the possibility. 

Any guidance on what to expect would be appreciated while we wait to see the ENT. From what I’ve read a tonsillectomy may help fix the problem (if it’s obstructive sleep apnea) so hoping to get some answers on that from the ENT.

SleepApnea,"So I was properly diagnosed with sleep apnea last month in November, prior to that I’d say months ago when I lift my arms up to hold a can opener or a car wash wand at work; let’s just say my arms hurt &amp; ache and get super painful after 1 minute in the air. I originally thought it was due to an autoimmune disorder like fibromyalgia but now I am thinking it has to do with my mild sleep apnea. As I feel like when my body gets less oxygen in my system the pain in my arms begins. For me I’ve noticed that sleep apnea symptoms come in waves. Do any of you get painful achy arms and your symptoms go away for months and come back? 

Still awaiting my cpap machine trial, so trying to do lifestyle changes. For a whole week I’ve been going to bed between 12am-1am and it makes my days worse.

SleepApnea,"I (23M) quit my job in January while continuing my online Computer Science degree (and just graduated). I haven't gone out much, and mostly hung out at home. Ever since I quit working, I haven't been sleeping as well.

It started out as just waking up a bit too early and feeling unrested, but as the months passed, I started to wake up several times per night. Things got so bad to where I would go to sleep at midnight and wake up at 2am on the dot every single night, and was wide awake with my heart pounding. It's worse on my back but happens on my side too.

The onset of my sleep problems felt so sudden that I thought it must have something to do with my new lifestyle at home. I considered that my vitamin D levels might be low simply because I hadn't spent any time in the sun or taken any supplements in the \~6 months after quitting my job. The same night that I started taking vitamin D, my sleep improved. When I woke up, I actually felt tired enough to go back to sleep. 6 weeks after starting vitamin D, I got tested and I wasn't deficient anymore. The problem is that I still wake up several times per night.

I have tried turning off screens 2 hours before bed, supplementing melatonin, magnesium, and even calcium. Nothing worked, and two types of magnesium both seemed to worsen my insomnia. I now do 30 minutes of cardio every day JUST because I needed to see if that would help me sleep (it didn't, but I continue to exercise anyway since it's a good habit).

My mom is a nurse and has one of those devices to measure blood oxygen level through your finger. Normally, I measure 95-99% blood oxygen. I've measured it two times now after waking in the night, and lo and behold, it was at 88% and 92%.

It's strange because I always feel congested these days too. I never got covid that I know of, and I've been vaccinated four times. I frequently wake up with a nasally voice, as though I'm sick. I can't figure out why my body is doing this. I want to make another doctor's appointment to talk about sleep apnea, but it sucks because I'll have to wait months to get answers while in the meantime my sleep is horrible.

I never had sleep problems that I was aware of at 18-21 and all of a sudden I can't get a single night of quality sleep. What also sucks is that I don't have a job or insurance, and the process to get a sleep study is going to be lengthy and expensive. I have absolutely no idea what to do. It feels impossible to move forward in life and get a job in my field if I feel like crap all the time.

I have always been a very skinny person as well (5'10 at 125-135 lbs). I have a history of vitamin D insufficiency, but now that I'm not deficient, I feel like I'm back at square one with no direction to begin solving this problem. It sucks to just be told ""Yup, you have sleep apnea, time to get a CPAP!"" even though I used to sleep like a baby \~1.5 years ago.
