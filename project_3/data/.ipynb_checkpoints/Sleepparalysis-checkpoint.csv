Sleepparalysis,"So I need to start this off by saying that I am aware that what I had was sp however I am struggling to find someone with similar experiences to me in terms of the interaction I had with my “demon” so I am just looking for conformation or an insight into what just happened as this was was no longer than 30 mins ago. 

This all begins when I am dreaming about going out with my girlfriend to a sort of sports bar (which I was supposed to do but didn’t as she had felt ill that day) in this we meet 2 men and end up inside, inside is reminiscent of my friends house which is in the same area as the bar.  The details of our conversation is something I can’t remember but long story short we end up killing one of the men his face mashed into a puddle of skull and blood as well as it being decapitated. I then see 2 people at the fort and back door (these are the same people) on the phone to the police so we begin to try to get away this was causing me to stress and I could feel my heart beady getting stronger and veins in my head pounding. 

Suddenly I wake up just as how I had fallen asleep but my girlfriend was talking to me about and I can’t stress this enough what just happens in my dream (during all of this I was lucid and was capable of moving in my dream) I then said to her that it’s not possible for her to have had the same dream as me and essentially be in each others identical dream. 

I then realise I could still be dreaming and attempt to pinch myself which I couldn’t feel so tried biting my finger to which I had no sensation. I then began to fell her lying on my chest but heavier than what is usually is (this is how I fell asleep before with her in my chest which is why talking to to her didn’t alarm me at first as I’m in her bed with her currently) i must also point out that whole time I had been talking to what I thought was her voice but I never seen her physically just speaking to her it is night and dark in the room so I also thought nothing more of this.
When I said to “her” it’s not possible for her to have been in my dream is when my body went limp and the weight on my chest appeared to enter my body with a deafening mechanical tinnitus sound being the only way for me to describe it. I tried to scream but couldn’t and then actually woke up next to my real girlfriend.

Sleepparalysis,"So for some background, when I was young I started lucid dreaming. Not regularly, but once every few months or so. But until a few years ago I NEVER had sleep paralysis, though I did have a friend that suffered from it and told me about it. 

The first time I had sleep paralysis, it was a very typical I wake up, I can't move, I feel like there is a thing in the bed with me, holding me down and putting pressure on my chest, and I see my sleep paralysis demon. In this case, a floating head with thorns all around it just above my head and a bit to the  right. It wasn't a fun time, and while it was happening I thought demons were actually real, and this was the confirmation I needed for that. At least until I fully woke up and realized that I had sleep paralysis for the first time. 

After that, I had bad sleep paralysis experiences 2-3 more times before it changed. It's always exactly the same, I wake up in the morning and it feels like someone is in bed with me, holding me down. Sometimes I see faces, sometimes I hear screaming or it sounds like someone it trying to open my door and come in (since I live alone, that's not a sound you want to wake up to haha). But it was so consistent, I began to recognize it in the moment. Knowing what it was, I would just relax and wait for it to wear off. No more fear or panic or anything. Just a slight inconvenience keeping me from getting up for the day.

Then it happened in the middle of the night. So instead of waiting and just waking up for the day, I relaxed and just let myself go back to sleep, which was the BEST decision I could have made. It immediately plunged me into a lucid dream. So now when I get sleep paralysis, I'm actually super happy about it. I give my sleep paralysis demon a smile of thanks and get on with going back to sleep. So I've actually come to look foreword to sleep paralysis and really enjoy it, since I know it means I'm about to lucid dream. 

I decided to finally look up how common it is to enjoy sleep paralysis and use it in this way. I wanted to post my story here for anyone interested in it, and to ask anyone reading if they have stories about enjoying sleep paralysis, and making your sleep paralysis demon a BFF.",t2_vghpqzlk,0,Stories About Enjoying Sleep Paralysis,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,11oa37t,True,Malebolge4,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/11oa37t/stories_about_enjoying_sleep_paralysis/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/11oa37t/stories_about_enjoying_sleep_paralysis/,54541.0,1678507073,0,,False,1678507089,1678507089,2023-03-11 03:57:53,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"I'll start off by saying I am an atheist, and I'm very comfortable with concepts of death (to me essentially returning to the state you were in before birth). 

My Dad, who I was very close to, passed away a few weeks back.  It was a bit out of the blue, but not a total shock as he'd been in long term recovery from a very large stroke 13 months ago. 

I come from a large family, but took the lead in getting things sorted for the funeral. The night before I had a sleep paralysis episode in which I felt my Dad was in the room with me but I was unable to move or say anything to him. After a minute or so I then was able to move, and looked around my room, saw it was clear and almost immediately fell back to sleep in a dazed state. I have had sleep paralysis episodes before (a handful in 36 years) in which I sense someone in the room but they are few and far between, the last one being a good few years ago. I have never before attached previous episodes with a notion of someone I know being in the room. It's always just been an unidentified presence. 

I appreciate I was in a heightened state of stress, but I hadn't had any issues getting to sleep and as an Events Manager by profession I didn't particularly feel too stressed about the plans for the next day.

Sleepparalysis,"Ok I know the title is a bit mad I get it...honestly I myself don't know whether to laugh or worry.
So bit of background about my sleep paralysis it usually tends to happen when I'm stressed and my depression has gotten bad. It hasn't happened for a while, I'm talking years but perhaps due to the stress of me losing my job and a bunch of other stuff I think the sleep paralysis and the whatever that thing is has come back. 

Last night I fell asleep and sometime after I would say a couple hours my sleep paralysis started and whereas before the demon thing waited menacingly usually near the side of my bed or the corner of my room, this time it was kinda already at my neck (literally) I felt it choke me but not in a way I couldn't breathe but i definitely felt the force and pressure, It kept choking me then called me a whore, which honestly kinda peed me cus why as a demon are you judging me. 

of course I couldn't move throughout the whole thing, and i know everyone who experiences sleep paralysis has their own ways to snap out of it but idk perhaps it's due to my catholic upbringing but mine tends to only go away when I recite prayers, it's weird because I am far from being religious now but for some reason that is the only thing that helps and this time it did as well, but the thing definitely didn't want to let go, it did eventually but I guess it just really didn't like me.

My own self diagnosis is that it's probably just stress related but I don't put it off completely because I've had some pretty weird paranormal dreams and experiences throughout my life but I honestly don't know what to make of my sleep paralysis, I use to have it quite frequently in the past so now I'm just like ok...that was weird and then move on.

So, its weird because when it happens it feels like i am only half awake. In that state i am aware of the fact that i am sleeping but also conscious. Its very hard to describe.

Sleepparalysis,"Honestly I'm 50/50 on whether these experiences can be classed as SP or not.

My mom usually wakes me up in the morning around 8-ish - she knocks on my door, and turns on the light to make sure I'm awake. This weird 'sleep paralysis' happens after I've woken up and said goodmorning (I almost always go back to sleep for 10-30 minutes).

So, I wake up, then immediately go back to sleep. This is where the weird stuff happens - it's happened twice now, both times when I've been a bit sleep deprived, but not to the point of exhaustion (e.g. lost ~1 of sleep due to barking dogs outside). In this second state of sleep, I'm not in *deep* sleep, but I'm aware of my body, and the fact that I'm in bed asleep. I'm making a conscious effort to try and wake up, but my eyes feel clamped shut (no medical explaination) and cannot be opened no matter how hard I try to break out of it. I have these weird half-dreams when I'm in this state, like my mum walking back into my room and having a full conversation with her. The last time it happened, she was trying to help me pry my eyes open, but she obviously wasn't *actually* there, it all occurred in my head. I eventually break out of it, usually when I relax enough to let myself wake up naturally.

Its definitely not the same kind of sleep paralysis experience I've heard about, but I'm wondering whether it 'counts' or not? Either that or I'm a complete idiot, and this is perfectly normal.

Sleepparalysis,"Sometimes when I start to fall asleep I can feel myself falling into an extremely deep sleep. Every time it has happened I end up waking myself up, gasping for air because I’m so afraid that if I fall deeper into It I will go into full blown sleep paralysis.

I ended up letting myself fall deeper last night and I started to lose the ability to move. I realized really quickly what was going on so I tried to make noise and eventually my boyfriend woke me up. 

There have also been other times where I will be laying in bed asleep, with my eyes closed but I can still see everything in front of me. Like my eyelids are literally see through. 

I’m just curious as to what this is.

Sleepparalysis,"hey guys, I wanted to chat with others that have experienced sleep paralysis or potentially see what you guys think about this..  

so last night I took a trazodone and some melatonin trying to fall into a deeper, longer sleep. It was a very normal dream at first, very vivid but normal nevertheless.. then it transitioned into something else, I became aware of myself sleeping and seeing my girlfriend next to me. we were in our bed like usual but in some sort of a field, I saw a faint light in the distance coming towards me.. I was still asleep but aware, and my girlfriend was sound asleep. as the light got closer I could see it was a lady frantically running towards me with a flashlight pointing at something like she was trying to warn me of something, initially I thought she was pointing at my girlfriend and I until she got closer I realized she was pointing above me trying to warn me there was someone tall, faceless, standing above me reaching down. I started to scream in my sleep and i could see my girlfriend waking up, turns out I wasn’t actually screaming because my mouth was still closed.. but I was still sound asleep trying to completely wake my girlfriend up, the lady with the flashlight was running away and he was still reaching for me. finally right before he got to me I squeezed my girlfriend and she woke up just in time, in a panic.

Sleepparalysis,"I feel like I basically get bootleg sleep paralysis.

I am conscious, but my eyes are closed, and I can't move.
I often end up falling back asleep unintentionally and feel completely trapped like I won't be able to get up. It's usually accompanied by a weird sensation, similar to that weird thing in your stomach when you fall, or go fast down a hill in a car.
But it isn't in my stomach, I feel it in the back of my skull, like near my brain stem.

Sleepparalysis,"I'm posting this weird experience just now. 
&amp;nbsp;

First things first, I know what sleep paralysis is and it should be while my body is asleep and my mind awake (my story is when I'm supposed to be asleep but please give it a moment). I've experienced it multiple times and I have done experiments while experiencing it in the past. I'm so familiar with it to the point that sometimes I just ignore it and I don't even notice that I've fallen back to sleep.
&amp;nbsp;

Now, I am asleep and dreaming. In my dream, I was in my younger days and was sleeping in a room with my siblings. At that age, I started experiencing SP but didn't know about them yet so I always thought it was night terrors. Whenever I experienced SPs back then, I always regretted not trying my best to make a sound for my siblings to notice that I am dreaming and wake me. So in this dream, I cried like a crazy person. And happily, I was able to.
&amp;nbsp;

The only weird thing is that it was such a success that I didn't know I was crying and making noises IRL. There are other people in the room and they woke me up because I was crying for help.

Sleepparalysis,"So last night around 1 a.m., i (m15) finally went to bed and started dreaming. Me and a friend were at a plant nursery, and my friend got his finger stuck in some fencing, but he didn’t want to remove it, after he finally removed his finger from the fence, i got my finger stuck in the fence. I started to panic, which caused me to “wake up”. I was mostly frozen in place staring at a dark corner of my ceiling that i had been looking at before i fell asleep. It looked like the room was lit with a red light, like the kind of color you get from a red lightbulb or those LED strips from tiktok. There was a grayish black   figure in front of me at the end of the bed. But i somehow used my hands to cover my eyes and i closed my eyes. And based on my logic in the situation, the figure wasn’t there if i couldn’t see it. But i could still hear a demonic voice in my ear (mainly in my left ear). The weird thing though, it was complimenting me. Saying motivation phrases. My weird thought was “oh is the devil my father and trying to contact me? cool!” While this was happening, it felt like my skin began to tighten, and it felt like it was gonna explode. At some point the voice said, “i love you” and i felt some sort of happy stimulation like when my partner says it, but with that feeling, i was still panicking because of the skin tightening feeling. I suddenly was able to move and started to try to move to the edge of the bed, almost trying to fall off to wake up or get my mothers attention. Right before i got to the edge of the bed, i woke up. I was in my side, back to where i was when i first got into the “sleep paralysis moment”. I then sat there and thought about it for a second. Then I got up and told my mother, who just told me to go back to bed and stop watching horror stuff.

Sleepparalysis,"Just dreamt about being helplessly lost at an airport with a never ending waiting terminal.

As I was waking up from the dream I opened up my eyes (or so I thought), laying perfectly still, when my covers started getting pulled and tugged at. Straight up towards the ceiling. 

I held on for dear life, as I felt extremely vulnerable without my covers! But next thing I knew, someone was whispering in my ear!!!
I couldn’t make out the words, but I knew that something was right next to me.

I flung out my arm - trying to smack the “thing” and as I did, my vision changed to my normal bedroom… i had opened my eyes for real this time. My heart was pounding, and my arm was stretched out next to me, as if I had tried to slam my fist down…

My covers were back where they belong. There was nobody sleeping next to me…

Sleepparalysis,"The first time it happened, I found myself in a dream riding on a train with my cousin. Suddenly, the train picked up speed and I realized I could control its velocity. I rushed through a kaleidoscopic visual until I burst through a bright light, similar to breaking through a wall. From there, I went through a series of sleep paralysis dreams. In one, I was immobilized and heard whispers around me. In another, I felt a shock on my neck that transported me to another dream where I stood frozen in my bedroom. Jumping between dreams and sleep paralysis was exhausting and unsettling for a first-timer like me.

After researching how to deal with sleep paralysis for future occurrences, I discovered a simple trick that worked wonders. One random night while experiencing sleep paralysis, I wiggled my toe until I regained control. It was a game-changing hack, and the experience was over quickly.

Fast forward four years to the present day. Though I knew my trigger, I thought I was entering a lucid dream. As I jammed out to a Stormzy song, I began running down a smooth purple-walled cave, leaping and twisting as I went. When I reached the bottom, I found myself in a room partially filled with water, where I was submerged and and quickly pinned to a wall. I began revolving around the room at an increasingly high speed that was almost exhilarating, and I felt like I was pushing against gravity. At one point, I could see my own reflection in the wall as I picked up even more speed.

Just as I thought I was entering a lucid dream, I suddenly found myself in sleep paralysis. A figure or ""demon"" appeared before me, and as I picked up speed, it transformed and taunted me with different forms, scaring and unsettling me. The strange thing was it looked like a doodle. I realized what was happening and used the toe-wiggling technique to regain control, though the demon still lingered. As I reached out to thin air, it faded away, leaving me somewhat shaken. I wasn't expecting a sleep paralysis dream, let alone one where I could see the demon so vividly.

It started with this really nice sounding upbeat pop song I’ve never heard before in English. If I focused on/leaned into the music I could hear it beautifully and when unfocused/pulled away I heard white noise.

I feel like this lasted for maybe 30 seconds, then abruptly the music stopped and I heard a woman sci-fi narrator say “You will fight the space aliens in 6 seconds”.

Suddenly my vision fixated kinda tilted towards the corner of my bedroom walls and I saw two dark figures/shadows side by side, then the figure on the left quickly disappeared and the figure on the right was more prominent.

Sleepparalysis,"So I have a question for any SP peeps out there. Well one main question, and a few others. I'll start with the main one, which the title refers to. It actually has me concerned. So first off, I get SP pretty often, and have since I was a kid. Multiple times a week these days, and this one weird thing usually accompanies it. It didn't always, but its become a lot more frequent in recent years. I'll feel these really intense and extremely uncomfortable sensations in my groin. I'm a guy, so its like my penis, but also just that entire area in general. The literal best way to explain it is that its like being tickled, but thats still not totally accurate. Its like being tickled to the point of it becoming painful. But I know that doesnt make much sense either because no degree of tickling is ever really painful lol. So I donno. In any case its incredibly awful and I dread the sensation. Has nothing to do with me being aroused or anything like that. Whenever its happening I'm of the exact opposite state of mind. Its repulsive. Especially under the circumstances of being immobile of course. It makes me really angry, as if someones doing it to me, and I basically come to ready to scream or throw something simply from the incensing, strangely painful, and seemingly violating nature of it. Anyway, does this happen to literally anyone else? It like genuinely worries me.

Another thing I think is weird with my SP is that a lot of the time it occurs before sleep. Like I'll be sitting there, close my eyes for a few seconds, then almost immediately feel the rush of the SP. Sometimes I jump out of it, but most the time it gets me. And during these episodes, I'm so convinced I'm conscious, because of the fact I like know for sure I didn't just fall asleep or lose consciousness. But even during these episodes I'll hallucinate something, Or have a lucid dream state experience. Like It'll happen when my cats sitting with me for instance, and during the SP I'll feel her get up, but then the SP subsides, I come to and shes there. So my point is, I always thought we project stuff AFTER we've woken up from a dream. But not only am I getting paralyzed before sleep, but I'm also hallucinating stuff in this pre sleep state.

And I guess lastly, does anyone else induce lucid dreams through their SP. Basically if I can wriggle free of it before the episode ends, I'll essentially come to inside a dream and I'm lucid. Never lasts super long, but its definitely a silver lining to my SP. Kinda balances my hate for it due to the aforementioned groinal sensation. But yeah, its kinda like, wriggling free from SP yourself isn't really ever possible, and it'll only ever end or let up, so when you do it yourself, you know its not real and you're hallucinating it, and basically about to 'wake up' into a dream.

So yeah, who out there does any of this specific SP stuff happen with, especially the first one (please tell me I'm not alone on that one)?

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve experienced this like three times and it’s just happened again and it’s hard to explain so if anyone knows more about sleep than I do maybe it’d you can help me figure out what’s going on 

So basically what happens is I’m asleep and I’m dreaming but i wake up in my dream sort of, I’m not really dreaming anymore but I’m still asleep it’s a strange feeling. 

And I get this whooshing sound in my ears and it feels like my body is being pulled upwards but I’m not moving and it feels shaky, like small quick spasms or like my bed is vibrating and some spinning or just movement like I’m on water 

And then I realize something is happening in my dream/awake state and I start to panic. I can’t pull myself out of it immediately but I know it’s happening and it’s a very anxious and scared feeling, and I have to think as hard as I can to wake up wake up and then I do and I feel a little out of it, probably takes about 10 seconds.

I tried to look it up and I considered sleep paralysis but I don’t think that’s what it is based on what people have told me of their own experiences with that.. 

I also thought maybe I’m having seizures but I feel like with a seizure there would be more movement, I’m pretty much still throughout this experience at least I think I am besides the vibrating feeling 

Idk it’s just so weird and it’s happened 3 times I can recount , it’s like I’m dying and my soul is leaving my body and i feel like I’m being pulled very quickly underwater ???",t2_iamxfbro,0,Earthquake/pulling feeling before waking up ?

Sleepparalysis,"I was exhausted and fell asleep within minutes tonight, so usually that means falling asleep, I may have an episode of sleep paralysis. Well, in this episode, I was in my room, awake (or so I thought), and I was trying on clothes in the dark. I decided to turn my light on, but it didn't work. I suddenly felt an overwhelming feeling of fear, and I ""ran"" out the door of my room. I knew I was experiencing sleep paralysis so I was trying everything to wake up. In my mind I was actually running out my bedroom door and then when I reached the stairs I thought it would be safe to just scoot down on my bottom, but in real life it felt like I was sleep walking and fell down the stairs trying to evade this feeling. I kept trying to open my eyes but everytime I have an episode it takes me a few chances to get my eyes open and then when trying to wake myself up doesn't work the feeling of suffocation or loss of breath occurs. That usually knocks me out of the state. When I wake up, I will immediately see the scariest people in my room, but they're always different, and I never recognize them.

Sleepparalysis,"I have been experiencing sleep paralysis regularly since I finished grad school in 2019. For me, it’s usually linked to daytime naps or having natural light in the room when I fall asleep, but not always.
One thing I’ve noticed is the same dream/ event in all of these episodes where I am trying to escape from somewhere/ someone and my eyes are stuck closed where I can only open a them and see a sliver of my environment and my trying to open them or pry them open with my hands constantly. When I wake up my face is always so sore but I didn’t think anything of it until my partner saw me one day on the couch repeatedly opening and closing my eyelids and thought I was in medical distress. 

Does anyone else have any experience with this or know of a way to stop it? I realized that falling back asleep after an episode throws me right back in to where my body freezes again but my brain is aware of what’s going on (I have auditory and visual “hallucinations” but I can’t move, and I can still recognize that I am in sleep paralysis)

Sleepparalysis,"I get sleep paralysis pretty frequently, usually due to life stress that i manage with limited success. My problem is that i’ve trained myself to panic and scream internally in my dream and hyperventilate during an attack because my breathing is the only thing i can control in my awake/dream/panic, and that either wakes up my partner who can shake me into movement, or if they don’t hear me, possibly lack of oxygen sends adrenaline or something through me and i wake up. 

Either way, this does NOT seem like a heathy coping mechanism. But… it generally gets me to wake up fully. 

I just want to sleep. I’m so tired, but I’m terrified of going back to sleep because if i have sleep paralysis twice in one night, it will happen again and again every time my body falls into light sleep or deeper dream-sleep. I’m on number 5 tonight and I’m just… done. 

I guess i’m tired of screaming into the void and I’m hoping someone else might have… any thoughts on this. Does a device exist that can sense the heart rate increase or something and have it vibrate in the hopes that might help me wake up properly?

(For reference my sleep paralysis is generally me waking up but being aware that my body isn’t. Sometimes i hallucinate like in dreams. Almost always i panic because i want to get up and move, but none of my body parts respond when i want them to move. Occasionally my eyes can flutter open and i can see the room around me, but again, my body is completely unresponsive to my terror. I feel building panic, and usually start mentally screaming, desperately trying to move ANYTHING—fingers, toes, eyelids. I may hallucinate that something moves, but i know thats not real. Only my breathing can be actually controlled so i end up hyperventilating and that usually gets me to launch bolt up right in bed where i either sit stunned for a while or burst into tears. Either way i generally try to get back to bed, but if it happens again, it will tend to keep happening all night. )",t2_dihy64yn,0,Does a device exist that can recognize SP panic and wake me up?,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,11gxmeb,True,Terrasina,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/11gxmeb/does_a_device_exist_that_can_recognize_sp_panic/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/11gxmeb/does_a_device_exist_that_can_recognize_sp_panic/,54418.0,1677840338,0,,False,1677840353,1677840354,2023-03-03 10:45:38,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"Hi everyone! I hope this post might help someone with sp.
I have sp since nine years. I had it like once or twice a month plus minus. Which is not that much and im really thankful about. But the sp was always really scary and i would say for me traumatic. I always sensed a evil presence. In the last two years or so it got worse as i saw the evil entity and sometimes it whispered or screamed at me. So yeah not very pleasant. 

Now the interesting part is i‘m taking psilocybin as microdose since maybe November or December 2022 due to mental issues and since then i had two or maybe three sp but all the fear is completely gone! I do no longer sense an evil entity. 
I still have the sp but its just a nice tingle in my body and i float out so i guess im starting to astral travel. But i can also just wake myself up. 

So my guess is that the psilocybin lowers my anxiety levels which is also proven in studies (dont remember the name)

Sleepparalysis,"I’m writing this because I just had a continuous SP and need answers.
whenever I have SP its when I have had the least amount of sleep and it’s clear. But what I don’t understand is it’s constantly reoccurring. For example my usual SP is not a visual character but a loud buzzing sound running around my room and I’ll usual struggle not moving and my heart rate will rise extremely (atleast that’s how it feels.) I’ll wake up within 0.5-1 minute into SP but the issue is when I fall asleep in 2 minutes I go back into that same SP which feels almost instantly.
Today however, same situation, but with an actual figure, I just identified it as a demon girl cause there was no other way of describing it. It would laugh in a really creepy tone and whenever I would look at her standing right beside my bed she would glance at me. I was able to wake up (scared of course) but I went back to bed. Same situation which felt almost instant but when I closed my eyes to not look at it and open again she was on top of me. SP is usually said that you can’t move your muscles but I was able to move my hand and when I brought it closer to her she would push it down and I could fully feel the force of her hand.
I guess my question is, is this SP or am I insane?

So I took a look around... And then I saw it.

Right at the foot of my bed to the left where the door to my attic room is, there was a freaking short grey alien peeking it's little head out. It was just there staring it me with it's big ol' eyes.

I was creeped the hell out, but was able to keep myself calm because I knew exactly what was going on. I knew I was experiencing sleep paralysis and what I was seeing wasn't actually there. As for why it was an grey alien, also knew why.

A few hours ago before bed I was watching a long stream of Vinesauce Joel (vargskelethor) play Voices of the Void, a game about searching for alien signals in space and being haunted by aliens. So aliens were fresh on the mind and it makes sense why an alien would be in my sleep paralysis.

So I kept my eyes closed. I was quickly able to move again and the alien was gone. Couldn't fall asleep again after that, as I was still creeped the hell out, but I was glad it was over.

This happens usually after work when I am exhausted and want to take a quick nap, and it only occurs when I am falling asleep. I can only describe it as having every thought that I have ever had occurring all at the same time, with a mix of extreme dread and horror in the background somehow, even with some irrationality like being in an alternate universe where normal physics do not make sense.

We paused the movie for one of my sisters to use the bathroom so all the lights were on and we were just waiting. 

I was fighting to stay awake since it was so late, so I accidentally fell asleep during this intermission and got SP.

I was doing my usual trying to move, groaning noise, and I was trying to tell them to shake me awake with my eyes. 

They know I get SP and I caught their attention pretty much right away and I heard my cousin say ""Um, should we do something?"" And my sister says, indifferent, ""No, don't touch her. We shouldn't wake her."" And my groans became intensified. A few seconds later I could finally move and I told them I saw and heard everything and we all laughed about it.

Sleepparalysis,"ive had my fair share of sleep paralysis which i eventually identified as stemming from sleeping at bad times 

Heres how my previous ones went:

First it almost always occurred when slept at 3am, then after an hour or two of some sleep id wake up with that ""wooshing noise"" as I've heard it been described. I recount it more as my heartbeat pounding in my ears. Sometimes there was a loomy figure, but often times not. At first it would be alright as I was long aware of sleep paralysis so my awareness caused me to not be afraid. However, the heartbeat would get pretty loud, fast, and painful until I eventually woke up usually this only lasted 10 seconds to a minute max. 

This time however was completely different, today I slept at 7am :| after taking a nap from 6pm-10pm and 2-4pm subsequently yeah I know my sleep cycle was fucked but normally I have nice sleep from 12-7. I digress. Today however, when I felt myself slipping into I dream I tried to ""hack"" it by becoming awake right before I slipped into a dream so I could be awake during my dream aka lucid dreaming but instead I failed miserably. What i felt afterwards is pretty indescribable but ill try. First it felt like everything melted away. I got a headache pang that quickly subsided but I transferred into some sort of sleep paralysis where i was awake and couldn't budge (standard ig). Then begins the real deal, I began to see hundreds of images every second of what can only be described as if ai generated art if it was told to create abstract. On top of that, it sounded like i was hearing noise from every frequency rapid firing sounding like little blips of noise. I felt so panicked yet calm (from once again my awareness) at the same time. Every once in a while id see an ominous figure and id be transported to a childhood memory where reality was heavily distorted kinda like the scenes in dr strange lol like this:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-G5rpTKE9Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-G5rpTKE9Q)

i tried escaping many times but to no avail sometimes i would wake up in my old bed and experience what was described above.

The other thing is when I'm awake in bed like I just woke up and this heaviness (?) feels like it wants to put me into a real deep sleep. When this happens it takes everything I have to fight against the feeling and get up.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi, I've always had occasional sleep paralysis since I was a teen; I'm 34 now. It doesn’t matter which room, city, or country I’m in. In most episodes, my mom rescues me by waking me up in the dream, but it's just me recovering my muscle functions in real life. When it's auditory, i.e. it begins with a painful static noise followed by some ""demon"" screaming, screeching in my ears, I pray – not religious but raised Catholic, so I've memorised the basic ones – until they stop. They visit when I’m extremely stressed, sleep deprived, or have a heavy late-night snack then proceed to sleep like a corpse in a coffin soon after. The Three Witches, a shadowy figure, Death, the Old Hag, Slender Man, and a family member or a relative are among some of my SP demons. An incubus who seemed like the human version of Michelangelo’s David came to me once, and it was the only sleep paralysis episode I slightly enjoyed. He had the softest skin and lips in the world, and I’ve never been touched or kissed by anything or anyone like that before. It was magical although I was literally petrified. I know it sounds wrong, but it was frightening in the beginning but pleasurable at the end. 

Anyway, a year ago, my boyfriend gifted me a “blessed” dreamcatcher from an old acquaintance who crafts and sells them. I don’t know if it’s psychological, but my sleep paralysis stopped. I still get dreams, but they’re no longer terrifying, just eventful and strange like most dreams are. When I did get a nightmare or two, I “emptied” that dreamcatcher by leaving it in the sun outside. According to Google, its power must’ve waned, and a combination of sun rays and breeze would naturally cleanse it. It’s been effective so far. 

I miss my sleep paralysis though. I don’t miss the demons; they’re vile and fucking scary, but I got so used to the episodes that I could easily recognize I’m having one of them when they come. I miss the fear, the inability to open my eyes or move a finger, the desperate but inaudible cry for help, the breathlessness and weight of something unknown pushing me while I struggle – all these happening at once while I could hear one of my parents restlessly moving about at dawn or my drunk flatmate noisily walking to his room. And I hate that I miss those feelings. Also, I wish to see “David” again.

Sleepparalysis,"Hey peeps,

Ik have experienced a few terror sleep paralysis episodes not really worth mentioning.

But lately I keep having this weird episodes where I am in bed trying to sleep. And when I’m almost asleep I feel children entering my bed. They act really fidgety and are quite annoying. It’s a really fucking weird sensation because I can literally can hear them speak to each other and it actually feels like they are there. It’s like the same thing I did when I was having nightmares at my parents as a kid. I don’t have any kids of my own, but it’s really annoying because it keeps me up. And when I manage to fall asleep I usually end up having a few night terrors before finally getting through the night. 

Like I said it’s really not actually that scary more sort of annoying and usually a sign that I will wake up while being chased by a serial killer in my dreams later that night.

Sleepparalysis,"Now, this isn’t my first experience with sleep paralysis, but it was the first time in a while. It usually happens during long periods of sleep deprivation.

It happened sometime last night between 0300 and 0600 because that’s when my newborn gets fed. I saw some sort of ‘shadow’ entity. It had a shapeless torso, no arms or legs, and two heads both shaped like a tigers with beady glowing eyes. It was standing in my closet and between me and the entity was were my daughter was sleeping

One of the heads was just staring at me and the other at my daughter in her bassinet. I tried to move to get in between my baby and this threat, but since it’s sleep paralysis, I couldn’t. All I could was muster a scream. 

My wife woke me up because I was screaming, freeing me from my bind, and I was able to finally get up and turn on the lights. No more tiger demon and my baby was okay. My wife comforted me and I cuddled with her and baby for a bit until I got my wits together and was able to go back asleep.

Sleepparalysis,"*long post* 

(22f) i don’t know why i just now thought of joining this sub. i’ve had sleep paralysis since i was a kid and it’s only gotten progressively worse growing up. i don’t really care if people don’t read this, i just want to get it out there.

the first time i got SP i was probably about 7-8 years old. i feel it was more of a hallucination rather than just feeling paralyzed. it started off with my ears feeling like someone was clapping their hands over them, like my head was between one of those monkey toys with cymbals. it was loud and fast. if you do it to yourself that’s exactly what it sounded like. this was followed by a tingling sensation that started in my head and went into my whole body. i hallucinated that the tv was staticky and loud, it was really fucking bright too. i wasn’t moving in real life but dreamed/hallucinated (not sure what to call it) that i lifted my arm up and bit my finger, and it squished down as if biting on soft wax. i eventually woke up and found that i hadn’t moved at all. 

there was a few years where i didn’t have any SP episodes and was fine. i had a lot of nightmares but can’t remember a specific SP experience until late freshman or sophomore year. in this episode i think my eyes were open but i can’t be certain. i was sleeping in the living room which had a view of the whole upstairs, where i saw shadows coming out of the walls and moving quickly towards me. the tingling sensation was there as well as not being able to move. i woke up and cried a bit but went back to sleep about an hr later. i told my parents the next day and my stepdad said he wanted to pray over me because of something called “sins of the father”, i’d never heard of it but he said it could be bad things passed onto me due to the wrong doings of my dad, or something like that.

i had episodes pretty regularly though high school, i got pretty used to it as they were almost the same every time so it allowed me to desensitize a bit. i would still get really anxious but it became easier to calm myself down and carry on sleeping. it was usually just the tingling and paralysis, i didn’t see any shadows or beings. 

within the last year and a half, my SP has gotten more… violent? in a way? i’ve hallucinated getting the pillow slammed on my face during paralysis, or being dragged off the bed by my hair. or the feeling of my body curling up even though i’m not moving, it’s so vivid i can feel the textures of the bed an i am genuinely surprised i didn’t move when i wake up.  i’ve picked up more auditory hallucinations as well, hearing faint whispers as i drift off to sleep sometimes. hearing someone call my name before falling asleep has always been normal to me though so no surprises there. 

within the last couple months i’ve been hearing much louder more distinguishable voices before i fall asleep and during paralysis. i’ve also been instantly falling into paralysis as soon as i close my eyes if i’m really tired. it honestly fucking sucks. as soon as i feel the tingles it’s like a trigger response to just get ready for anything to happen. 

a couple weeks ago it happened where SP kicked in soon as i closed my eyes. i heard really loud whispers and a voice louder than all the others that was so raspy it was basically a growl. it sounded like a high pitched goblin creature, and i felt like it was right behind me. 

but last night i had the most unique SP episode to date. i stayed up really late, probably til about 4:30am so i was super tired. i closed my eyes and the tingles set in immediately so i knew what was up. except this time was different because there was a single voice that said “hello! can you hear me?” naturally, i was surprised because this was the most clear auditory hallucination i’ve ever had. before i could process what happened it was as if a whole giant call center full of people were saying things like: “hello can you hear me” “can you hear me” “no can you hear me” “hello!” etc and it was incredibly loud. it was really overwhelming and i felt so small because i couldn’t be in control of my own head. i didn’t want to open my eyes because i was afraid i would see something and i felt like my body was curling up into a fetal position. eventually i was able to wake myself up after a lot of hard and heavy breathing. a couple minutes of recouping and calming myself later, i closed my eyes again but of course i wouldn’t be let off easy. this time i didn’t get a chance because the voices immediately came back louder and sounded more distressed, even. there was this one really deep growling voice louder than all the others that was indistinguishable, unlike the other little voices that were saying the same “can you hear me?” phrases. this voice would say an indistinguishable sentence, make its voice deeper, say another sentence, and ultimately in an even deeper tone just did a really loud long growl. it almost sounded like a tripod from war of the worlds if you’ve ever seen it. it was fucking terrifying. to go with all of that, i felt like i was being dragged off the bed. i was begging myself to wake up and screaming inside my head. i finally woke up hyperventilating and calling out for my boyfriend. after some time and comfort i was able to fall asleep without any SP, but kept waking through the night. 

i’m not sure how bad this can get and i’m scared to find out, but also morbidly curious. i just want my experience out there for anyone who might be interested, and it helps me to write it out. last night was just really out of the norm for me, and it’s what made me look up this sub. if you’ve made it this far thanks for reading, if you relate then i’m glad i’m not alone. and you aren’t either.",t2_a1pwfe9o,0,i just want to talk about it,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,11cyt2q,True,notturmomm,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/11cyt2q/i_just_want_to_talk_about_it/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/11cyt2q/i_just_want_to_talk_about_it/,54359.0,1677460669,0,,False,1677460680,1677460680,2023-02-27 01:17:49,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"Guys, I’ve experienced SP for years. It was way more frequent before and I had textbook symptoms (feeling a presence, auditory-visual hallucinations, etc). But over the last two years the symptoms really started to change - first of all I don’t get them very often anymore (twice or thrice a month) and every time I do I end up even doubting if it was SP or something else. 

I always start of with this weird buzzing in my head, which I recently realized is basically my pulse, my ears start to ring- which gets worse if I focus on trying to move my eyelids, I feel painful pressure on my jaw and I’m not even clenching it or anything, just pressure (though I think it might be because I wear a retainer at night), my whole body feels like it’s vibrating from the inside - not shaking physically - just like intense electrical buzzing, and if I imagine a sensation, I can feel it. Like if I think about a demon choking me or pulling on me, I feel it. I’m not scared during it, more like overwhelmed with the painful and disorienting symptoms, so much so that I don’t even think about moving. 

That’s why I start doubting if it’s actually SP, because I never actually feel like I’m paralyzed. 

I couldn’t find anything about my symptoms so…

Sleepparalysis,"Hey, what I'm about to tell you is not sleep paralysis, but I think it could be categorized under the topic of night terror or normal dreaming phenomenon. 

The other day I was sleeping and woke up again in the middle of the night, however when I became aware of what was happening I had already been screaming. I found myself realizing that my mother was telling me from her room in the distance what was going on. And then I became aware that I had been screaming my mother's name out loud asking for help, I had never done that before, it seems that I was in a state between wakefulness and sleep, because I did not become aware of what had happened until she started to answer me. 

What marked me most about this experience is that I really felt that I was in danger in my room, and that there was something trying to hurt me, but I could not remember what it was, it is a sensation to feel that you have shouted or asked for help but you feel that you have not really been yourself, as if it had been someone else. Another strange thing is that I was terrified then, I wanted to answer my mother but I couldn't, I felt like I couldn't talk, (I was awake, it wasn't sleep paralysis) and I was exploding all over my room with my eyes and my door mostly with fear because I felt there was something dangerous, and I couldn't get up to talk to my mother because of that.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi, for last few months, on and off, and I've been having these strange dreams.

Strange not in their content, but in their affects. I will be distinctly dreaming, and it is typically a nightmare, but I want to make it clear it is not a hallucination. I am still very much asleep (eyes closed, unconscious, etc).

Where it gets weird is that I am conscious of my body in this state. I get that horrible locked in feeling, mostly in my arms or neck. This usually comes in lapses and will happen several times in one night. Nightmare + locked in state, but I'm not awake.

It's weird to describe. And googling it seems to only result in SP, but I don't think it quite fits. Anyone have any idea *what* it is?

Sleepparalysis,"Okay, first thing is that I take alot of meds for my mental health and I take 4 diffrent meds so I can sleep or I will stay awake and start hallucinate and my brain just ”force” me to sleep. 

So my meds I take for my sleep is 
Venlafaxin ( for my depression)
Quetiapin ( for my anxiety )
Propavan ( so I don’t wake up)
Teva-Prazosin (so I don’t have any nightmares) 

Second, I have alot of lucid dreams, can’t get rid of them.. but I’m 100% aware that I dream and can do what I want. 90% of my dreams is just nightmares. 
I get sleep paralysis time to time, but i’m pretty Good at getting out of it.

So.. my doctor fucked up with my meds and I was without them for a week.. (I have them now) and earlier today I was laying in my moms bed and then its like my brain took a printscreen and the only thing I can see is that I’m on my phone watching youtube and I know I’m not sleeping, I can move my body, but the only thing I can see is that ”printscreen”. I can feel how I’m trying to end the video and trying to call my mom for help because I started to panic.. my mom can see that I’m moving, laying there with my eyes open and acting strange. 

And then I started to have a pretty bad nightmare, I’m can feel how I’m trying to wake myself up but its like my brain just don’t listen and have to restart and I have to be in this nightmare and when I can wake myself up I’m sweating, almost hyperventilating and when I've calmed down and alert its feel like I've slept a whole night. My brain was ”gone” for 2hours and I just went up from the bed and didn’t go back.

Sleepparalysis,"Hoping for some advice!

A few weeks ago, I remember I was dreaming…but in the process of waking up, I guess? It’s so hard to explain. It definitely wasn’t a bad dream or anything, but I woke up screaming because it felt like someone wrapped their arms around my waist. It was really bad, I’ve only woken up like that in fear one other time because of a nightmare.

Fast forward, and it happened last night/this morning to me but it felt like something or someone was poking or tapping the back of my shoulder a few times. Jolted up screaming again.

Recently increased a dosage of my medication, so I’m not sure if that’s was causing this or what.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve never opened up about this topic. But I want to see if more people relate to this.

The first time I remember experiencing SP happened when I was 15 yo. It was as scary as people tend to describe their own SPs. It happened whilst waking up, alone.

Then, I went probably about a year or more without another episode until it hit me…again. Nevertheless this time it occurred in a room with more people. I was in the upper bunkbed when I felt it happening. The difference resides in that this particular time, I was not alone in the room. Hence feeling safer.

But it was not until my third episode that things really took another turn.

This time I was in the same place as my second one, or at least that’s what I can recall. I once again felt it happening, I knew it was close as I began sinking in the mattress and the space got darker. Yet this time, I felt completely safe and I was actually able to enjoy it. For it felt rather relaxing.

From there on, I began chasing that sensation. I would even try to “control” it. I would concentrarte on having it and then right before it fully impaired me, I’d simply shook it off. It’s almost as if there is a threshold that the body goes through before completely going into SP. however sometimes I wouldn’t be successful and get paralysis.

Yet the more I’d practice the better I became at it, until one day, I finally experienced the so called OBE. The best sensation I’ve ever felt (sleep related). But that’s another story

Time went by and I got carried away with other thoughts before going to sleep. Adult life kicked in and I slowly drifted away from practicing SP and OBEs. 

But about a year ago,  After bumping into a post about this topic, I began trying to recreate it again. Yet I’ve only managed to fail.

I hope this night It happens writing this. If so I’ll let you know.

Sleepparalysis,"One time I was taking a nap on the couch in my living room because I was having a pretty bad migraine. When I woke up from the nap I woke up to sleep paralysis. This was the first time I had sleep paralysis since I was a child. I didn’t realize what was happening, since I didn’t want to get up from the couch I didn’t notice the fact I couldn’t move. I saw my boyfriend laying on the floor curled up in a ball on the carpet. I didn’t think much of it because I assumed he was playing with the dog or something. But then I saw him walk down the stairs and walk into the kitchen, his body was still laying on the floor. That’s when I tried to get up and ask him what he was doing. At that point I realized I couldn’t get up or speak, still not realizing I was in sleep paralysis. A bit of panic set in as I couldn’t get up. The person I thought was my boyfriend on the floor disappeared. I started to move my arms and shimmied my way out of the paralysis. I got up, my head still banging from the migraine and looked for him in the kitchen. He wasn’t there, he was in my bedroom the whole time while I was sleeping despite me seeing him walking around and laying on the floor.

Sleepparalysis,"I've had sleep paralysis for a couple years now, at first it used to be every night but over time it's been ready now and then to just extremely rare. For context, I'm 21 and still live with my parents. Sometimes I've had really bad episodes to the point where I leave my room and either sneak into their bed, wake one of them up to get into the bed or like right now, try to stay up for the rest of the night.

This is my first time coming on this sub and I just read the rules, specifically the spiritual rule so I'll try to be as devoid from religion as I can, please bear with me.

I went to sleep around 12:30am or at least tried to sleep. I've probably been awake the whole time and at this point I have enough experience to know when my body is about to sleep before my subconscious does. In essence I can sense when I'm about to have a sleep paralysis episode. I'm not sure if I can lucid dream but lately I try to image/conjure up weapons for me to use while I have said episodes just as a way to try and cope with my paralysis. For at least half an year I've been experiencing episodes of paranoic schizophrenia, I haven't gotten diagnosed yet because I've only got emergency insurance, therapy is too expensive in California and I havent been able to hold down a job until I started one just yesterday/Thursday February 23, 2023. 

Sorry I keep going on tangents, but as I was saying, I was trying to sleep at 12:30am and felt an episode starting to trigger and I tried to fight it. I can wake myself up out of my paralysis by first starting with wiggling my toes and eventually moving my legs and then arms. I woke myself up and started breathing but kept laying down on the bed when a second episode triggered. Yes, I can have several sleep paralysis episodes mere moments apart.

Here's where I'll try to refrain from any religious stuff as I can possibly explain. I did a research paper for my senior year in high school on Sleep Paralysis so I researched all I could but not finding much information because as far as I'm aware, it's not a field of science that can be thoroughly studied without going into speculation. Anyway, I felt the 2nd episode trigger and from the corner of my eye, just over my blanket, I saw something in the darkness that sent a chill down my spine or more specifically, upto my head. It looked like it was a dark mist but what sent me over the edge was what appeared to be a paid of glowing white eyes staring at me and I internally screamed/yelled and faced away from it.

I don't know if anyone has ever experienced what I have during  sleep paralysis, but most of the time I have some kind of mental attack but more specifically an auditory attack. What happens is basically having static or just a huge amount of pressure blasted into my ears and pressure on my head like it's being squeezed. This type of episode happened 30 minutes ago as of this paragraph. My memory of the incident is already starting to fade but I think I just snapped myself out of it again by doing the same thing I always do but instead I immediately made my body move so a 3rd episode wouldn't trigger because of my muscles recovering from the paralysis.

It's now 2am, I'm not going to sleep for the night. The 2nd episode ended at 1:30am.

Sleepparalysis,"it’s currently 2:57 am and I have been trying to sleep for the past 2 hours, and this is my second time tonight scaring myself out of my sleep. I experienced sleep paralysis a lot as a child and as an adult it usually happens whenever I sleep facing up so I usually just sleep on my side or facing down to avoid it. But lately I have been having what I can best describe as “false awakenings” but these false awakenings are always in a sleep paralysis perspective. it often feels like I’m just experiencing sleep paralysis until I jolt myself awake and realize I was actually just dreaming. It’s truly terrifying to experience, I often see myself lying down from my own eyes (not from like a third person perspective) exactly in the way I fell asleep with my surroundings exactly the same; for example; my cat was on my right side cuddled up next to me when I fell asleep so in my dream it was the exact same, so that’s why I always confuse it with a sleep paralysis episode. but when I scare myself awake i know it was a dream because he wasn’t there anymore so I know I just dreamed of it. I’m aware it’s going on as one is in sleep paralysis and I’m trying my hardest to move and often can to an extent, but as it goes on it gets more and more terrifying, I can feel an extremely strong vibrating in my head to the point it physically hurts and even freak myself out and see things at the end of my bed or corner of my room. Tonight I saw a black figure standing by the door and even thought someone was running towards me, I was literally about to cry from how real it felt and after struggling for what felt like forever I woke up and wasn’t so scared anymore and could tell I was really fully asleep the whole time.

Sleepparalysis,So I'm 28 years old and I've always loved sleep. It's my time to escape and I love rest because I have a pretty stressful life and have always loved my vivid dreams. For the past two weeks I have been what seems like waking up because I'm fully aware of my room and my surroundings and even what's on my tv that I leave playing while I go to sleep but I have this feeling that something is grabbing me or holding me down and I can't move and I can't speak when it's happening. I've even seen it but it's like a shadow. It's like a nightmare that I'm actually experiencing in my actual room and life and it's scaring the shit out of me. It takes what seems like forever to snap out of it and I don't just wake up from sleeping I feel like I'm awake the whole time because when I'm finally able to move and speak it's the same exact setting as when I was unable to do so. Now I'm scared to look myself in the mirror and I'm scared to even sleep sometimes now no matter how tired I am. Has anyone else experienced something like this?

Sleepparalysis,"Context:

I am having Sleep Paralysis for probably close to 17 years, not on a daily basis but at least two times a month. 

At first it was a very horrible experience, unable to move, while ""things"" happening around me. It was also not always accompanied by a ""scary"" figure, sometimes I was just lying there, unable to move. The figures where never hostile, very rarely did they even touch me and I could never ""feel"" the touch. Everything else was filled in darkness, so I could only make out vague shapes, to see something more clear it needed to be right next to my face and even then it wasn't looking ""clear"".

Over time I became aware of what was happening, mostly by noticing a change my room like the wall not being to my right, missing furniture, Windows and so one. So, I tried to move while it was happening in the hope of influencing or ending it. I tried to move my limbs for a long time, with no success, just making my limbs feel tense instead of moving them. I am able to look around the ""Room"" by moving my Eyes, head movement is very slightly possible.

&amp;#x200B;

What happened:

My eyes opened with something at the end of my bed, resembling a figure of sorts. Very slender and short, hidden in the dark, making me unable to see any facial features. It crawls under my blanket on the right side of my bed next to the wall. I can see it moving under the blanket. Then a head pokes out right next to my face, but no eye contact. It looks like a young man, close to a child showing no emotions. It stares past me to my left. And climbs over my upper body, sitting down on the left side of the bed, I don't feel anything. My eyes moving with it.

And then it slides down, ""slides?"", that was the moment where it hit me, my bed dosen't has a slide (as a child i had a bed with a slide). My mind goes from observing to forming thoughts, what is happening I want to know. My Eyes follow the shadow creature, it is now so far away that I barely can see it, my head feels tense from looking so far to my left. Now feeling even a slight hint of control, I want to know!

I let out a puff of air hoping to make a sound, and it actually works. Whispering in a breathless voice, I say, ""wait... come... back"" and to my surprise the shadowy figure actually does, it goes to the end of my bed, and climbs up a ladder and sits at the position where it started.

I try to speak again, and under great pressure I let out a faint ""who... are... you"", the figure answers, in a whispering but not breathless voice, saying the name of my little brother, nothing more, not moving, seemingly waiting.

&amp;#x200B;

(For context, my little Brother is the most important person in my life, we went through a lot growing up together and still have a strong bond as adults.)

&amp;#x200B;

I was feeling a bit at ease by hearing that answer but was struck with confusion. So, I tried to ask ""why are you here"" but I couldn't get out the ""why"", as a native german speaker saying ""Wieso"" i couldn't get enough air so it cut of the second half of the word. To my surprise again, the shadow at the end of my bed, started to guess, what I am trying to say, incorrect aswell. Which confused me even more, since I already realised that I am in sleep paralysis, so why would my mind guess wrong to what am I trying to say?!

&amp;#x200B;

So I asked a different question, ""what are you doing?"" and with the mundane whispering tone, I received the answer I was not hoping for: ""sliding"". It made my mode switch completely I started giggling and huffed an ""oke, fine."" I wanted to say, ""you do you"" and see if the shadow would come close again to slide down the slide. But I woke up.

&amp;#x200B;

Being awake now, my heart was racing and I was sweating a lot, I was feeling like being full with adrenalin and I could not go back to sleep. I would have loved to ask more questions. And I didn't feel frightened like I normally do after sleep paralysis. I was quite happy even, I also noticed that the figure did resemble my little brother but not from the last time I saw him, probably more like the age of 9-12 which would be around 12 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

As this happened the first time to me now, I am curios how my next experience will be. The first time in my life I am not afraid of my next sleep paralysis experience.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi, I'm a 20-year-old Male who has been diagnosed with sleep apnea I even use a cpad to sleep. Now for the past 2 years, I have been having this weird night terror frequently happening to me. Way too frequent for it to be sleep paralysis imo. Now it varies as to when it happens. For example, it can happen as I move position in bed, It can happen out of nowhere, etc... Now as to what it's like. Well, I just had it happen again(2nd time this week) to me around 24 minutes ago when I woke up to snooze my work alarm and headed back to sleep. As I went to sleep I felt overwhelmingly sleepy and I started to freak out and fight the sleep and tried to stay awake I tried to move but I couldn't and I felt like I was growing physically weaker.

Sleepparalysis,"The first couple of times I've had it, I've just been stuck. Laying there. Unable to move but knowing where I am. Seeing my room. Mostly calm and knowing it will pass.

It started with I 'woke up' and heard the voice of a friend of mine as clearly as he was next to me. He told me about something game related and I wanted to reply but couldn't move. I had like flashes of what seemed like dreaming I was reaching out for something like my phone. But next I'll be back unable to move. 
Then I heard my dad. Yelling at me. He does that if I sleep too long and we're going some where. Just I was in my own apartment. And I could imagine how he was looking but I could also see that where the voice was from, he wasn't there. Then my brother started yelling my name too as he would if I didn't reply in real when at my parents place. Again I could imagine how he looks, but not see him. I heard them go on with their day, moving things in the kitchen at my parents place. Etc. 
Through all of this I could hear the music my neighbors are playing in real at my apartment.
Next was what freaked me out the most. My old dog who has been dead for years joined me in my bed. I felt her, crawl, jump, move around on top of my duvet. She climbed under it and I felt her fur against my leg. Soon after she came up to my shoulder and I felt her wet nose against me.
I knew I had to break free now and managed to force my self into a more lucid dream, my dog vanishing and me imagining my self sorting something on Facebook and having images of hanging out with those I wanted to invite. But it was like two sides.wrre fighting. Kept being dragged back in this unmovable state. 
Then. An asian man I've never met or seen before started wandering my flat. I can't remember what he was saying but at this point I was getting extremely frustrated. 
And finally broke free.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve been having sleep paralysis since I was about 17 I’m 25 now
Early on it was random and very terrifying 
But I figured it was just nightmares 

Around age 21 I would have SP which consisted of a few different girls trying to kill me. These girls would be girls I’ve had relations with or having relations with but since I’ve always been spiritual I took it as a sign to remove whichever girl was in my dream out of my life sooner or later…

At around age 23 I started noticing whenever I went to sleep watching something scary or anything related to death I would have SP…. And when I say anything related to death I don’t mean funny cartoons like family guy which death occurs but I’m talking about shows like first 48… When I have SP I have trouble breathing but because I noticed what was triggering it I was able to slow it down. Around this time I was having SP about once a week… 

I’m now 25 and I’m sick and tired of this. It still mostly only occurs when I fall asleep watching such things but I’m very curious as to why this is happening to me. I can be downstairs sleep and if my girlfriend is upstairs in the room watching such things I still will slip into SP just by barely hearing these movies or shows.

When in SP I am aware I’m dreaming but I have been through a lot in my short life like being shot multiple times, and because of that when in SP my breathing seems to be very abnormal, I have learned to wake myself up by twitching  my body over and over again till I wake up…

Can someone help me please it’s 2:40am
My girlfriend is upstairs sleep with the TV on forensic files
And if I don’t turn the downstairs tv up all the way to where I definitely can’t hear what she’s watching I will fall back into SP
this can happen multiple times in a day but mostly a couple times out the week since I have been able to control what my sleeping brain hears…

Sleepparalysis,"I have had sleep paralysis since I was at uni, the first times I can remember being maybe 18 or 19. 

today I woke up at 2am to sounds of blood curling door slams, as if someone was angrily slamming the door next door in my building. I counted 4 slams. I swear it felt so real.

At this moment, my eyes began to open as slits. Immediately I knew what was happening when I realised I couldn't move. 

Through my half open eyes, I remember seeing a figure, dark figure, looking through my open door frame. Somehow my mind was interpreting the doorknobs that i could see on either side of the open door as eyes. 

But I knew better. my mind told me not to believe it, as it knew I was in paralysis. I couldnt move naturally. I tried to speak or yell but I know I only made some unintelligible mumble or gurgle sound. 

Then after about 20 seconds of this half-conscious state, I fully came to muscle control and vision with a gasp. my heart was pounding. I realised then there was no slamming of doors. the eyes were clearly just the doorknobs.  

I laid there at 2am, alone, unharmed, scared but technically safe but still unable to fall back to sleep and just wanting to be held and comforted.

Sleepparalysis,"I've never, ever, experienced anything even close to what I experienced last night. Let me preface this with a wee bit of context.

I haven't been sleeping the greatest. I've been having rolling waves of adrenaline for the last few weeks. It's like the moment I try to turn my brain off, relax my body, and get some rest... I begin to have these unbelievably scary ""rolling"" waves of adrenaline. I first thought it was a panic attack, which I've suffered for the first time ever about a month ago, but it's not. It doesn't feel like a panic attack. It's just this shuttering in my heart and the obvious feeling of surging adrenaline - over and over and over. I've learned to kind of manage it with meditation, and I will eventually fall asleep.

Last night, I didn't experience the adrenaline waves. I got into bed, and just closed my eyes peacefully. It was late - 3-4 AM - and I was tired. I dozed off.

I was dreaming of a mouse. There is a tiny little mouse that lives in my flat, and I'm not killing him. I just leave him. I don't care, and it doesn't bother me. I have seen him a few times and it's not some gross mouse or rat, it's a tiny little mouse that hides all the time. I was dreaming of this mouse, but I don't remember the context. Before I woke up, I had this vision of a tall, long-beaked (Vanilla Sky masquerade mask-type beak) with black eyes standing over me, just peering down at me and kind of smiling.

This feeling of being watched caused me to wake up. I couldn't move. I thrashed my body, but if I didn't thrash consistently I had to start all over. It was like momentum was what I needed to save myself. I tried to reach my phone to call for help, but I couldn't move three feet. I tried to speak, but I couldn't formulate words. I tried to free myself, but I literally couldn't.

While I was fighting for my damn life, there was a baseball-sized ""galaxy-like"" object coming into my vision, in my bedroom, hovering over my head as I thrashed. It was moving and spinning, and the lights were dim and warm. When I finally managed to shake myself out of it... I am not kidding you I say the lights fly across my window and my window slammed.

I FELT different. I felt stronger, healthier, and further away from people. I felt like... different. I know this sounds fucking stupid, but it was REAL. I grabbed my phone and realized that only 45 minutes had passed. It felt like I'd slept the entire night. 

Here is where shit gets weird for me.

I got up to get some water, and to get out of the room. I'm an adult, and I've never really been afraid of anything in the way I was afraid of that room. It wasn't like the boogeyman stories afraid, though... it was viscerally afraid of something that had tangibly affected me.

I used the bathroom, smoked a cigarette, and flossed my teeth just because. I was staring out my window, smoking, and it was 5:15 AM... there was a sound like our building door closing, but there are only three of us in the whole building. A man or woman in all black, face not visible, was rolling a black suitcase behind them in silence. They didn't look back or up. They just walked.

Then, I heard the mouse in my kitchen scratching at something.

Then, I noticed that the triptych's middle image in my bedroom was askew, and I shit you not... it says ""Shoot for the Moon"". The flat was someone else's and I moved in when they bought a new flat. 

Anyway, I recorded this entire situation and experience in a journal quickly... audio note journal, and then went back to the bathroom one more time before getting back in bed.

On my way out of the bathroom, I had this feeling pulling me to a small 8x10 image hanging on the wall... it's an old Renaissance print showing a group of men piled on top of one another in agony, with one or two guys at the top in the sun. They're like stuck on some beach or rock or something. It was just very weird. I've never even looked at it before.

When I moved into the flat... I noticed that I never see anyone here. Ever. Both flat doors that aren't mine have signs on them that say ""Please, do not disturb"" and I haven't ever seen a human coming into or out of those doors. The woman that met me here was Eastern European, older, and kind of odd when I arrived on the first day. I can't explain how or why, but it was super weird.

Is this just sleep paralysis? Can it be that simple? I've suffered from anxiety and full-blown panic attacks that left me in the A&amp;E worried I was having a cardiac issue recently. I've never been uncomfortable managing stress, and I've never really felt like I was anxious or whatever. 

I need to understand how something like this could permeate my physical body. I'm not a believer in the paranormal. I'm a software engineer. I believe in science and probability. I'm not religious, but I understand there is a basis for religion in the very basic sense that most stories have a kernel of truth in them.

I literally FELT something inside my entire body, and when it left my body... it left as a kind of golden light-rimmed cloud or something. I FELT strong; sharp. I felt like society was in danger or weak or something was really wrong and I was now aware of it.

Forgive me for rambling. This was just too much for someone who is resoundingly NOT into this kind of thing. I've noticed a lot of UFO stuff lately. I know that sounds dumb... but I actually have. I recorded something I shared here and on TikTok; I am a very analytical person. These were defying the laws of physics. I don't know.

Sleepparalysis,"I recently had an entity enter my room in sleep paralysis, pull down the blanket and place a long grey skinny finger on my chest and chanted a sentence in Latin that ive never heard. I don’t know Latin, but I felt that it was Latin, when I looked up the meaning it was indeed Latin or old Norse. It was in a black cloak with a slightly pointed hood, he had hollowed eyes and a pointed nose. It had a familiar or something of that sort in the corner of my ceiling, it had king stretched ribs and a goblin face with thin skin and talons at the end of the wings. 

It was frightening but when I woke and started processing it and looked up the meaning, I feel as if it where trying to protect me, as the worlds meant protection (i don’t like repeating specifics to the public, magic is very sensitive and I don’t want to make any mistakes)

Sleepparalysis,"So for probably the last few years I've been having this experience where I go to sleep and it's just darkness. It doesn't happen everyday but it happens often enough for me to remember. 
When this happens, I don't have any concept of time or self or anything. I'm conscious but I don't know who or where I am or what I am. It's like... Idk being a grain of sand in the desert. I don't have a body, I cannot see, I cannot feel. There is no sensation, no pressure or anything. Nothing happens, it's just dark and I just am. 
At first it was kind of scary because I would strongly feel like I was forgetting something like the fact that I'm a living breathing person. But after a while I just got used to it and now I even seek it out. Lol, I really try to get to that place where I just exist but also kind of don't exist. Now, when it happens, I suppose because it's happened so much before I can finally remember that I am a person. It's still dark and I remain a bodiless form but there's always that notion 'ah yes, I'm a person'. However, up until now I still couldn't tell you if I remember who I am when it happens but honestly it's not a problem to me because I'm just chilling. 
The only thing that brings me out of it is when I'm awoken by some external factor (my dog barking, my phone ringing, my alarm etc) or when I suddenly realize I haven't set my alarm and probably have work soon and so floating around in whatever tf it is will make me late.
Everytime I google it I get sleep paralysis or other results that do not coincide with my experiences. I'm just trying to figure out if it's a recurring dream, is it sleep paralysis, is it something else? A lot of the posts here sound hella scary but my experience is not so I'm just having a hard time relating but I have no idea what else it could possibly be.

Sleepparalysis,"I had to have been around 4-6 years old I can’t really remember. The majority of my childhood my mom slept in my bedroom with me, I was sleeping alone this night so I was having trouble sleeping. I woke up in the middle of the night and heard the voices of two men coming from the window closest to my bed. I tried to scream out to my mother because I was scared someone was out there watching me sleep, but I couldn’t I was stuck in place. I turned my head facing the open floor in my bedroom and there it was, I had seen something I still can’t get out of my head to this day. A beast, standing about seven feet tall covered in hair standing on hooves with beaming red eyes staring at me. It didn’t look like a ghost or an entity it looked real. It’s saliva matted into its fur below its mouth full of sharp crooked teeth glistening in the moonlight shining through my window. I could hear it breathing. I soon as I saw this creature I was freed from the paralysis, but it didn’t go away. I jumped from my bed straight to the closed door I would always keep open at night. It just stood there, eyes locked on my bed. I tried turning the door knob but it wouldn’t budge, I started screaming and banging on the door looking back at the thing making sure it wasn’t advancing towards me. No one came to help me. I woke up the next morning laying in front of the door in a puddle of my own urine and feces.

Sleepparalysis,"So I get SP a LOT. There are periods of time where I will get it multiple times a night for days or even weeks in a row. It’s gotten to a point where I can force myself to either fully wake up or make enough sound while I’m under (whimpering, hyperventilating, crying, etc) that my bf notices and shakes me out of it. As a result of this frequency I’ve had countless legitimately horrific experiences with visual hallucinations. I’ve drawn some (and burned it out of fear fr) and can remember most very very vividly. I’ve even felt what I can only describe as human hands or claws on my body and unfamiliar faces under my own hands with not chance of external stimuli. Won’t go too much into all that but a few nights ago I experienced something new:
I was having my usual multi-layer round of sleep paralysis. I ‘wake’ to more and more paralysis a few times before waking up fully. This time I get to maybe round 3 or 4. And as I lay there waiting I hear two children speaking. They’re talking to each other. About me. They wonder if I can hear them and what I’m going to do about it if I can. They sound maybe 5-8 years old. Boys I think. Most of my auditory experiences have been music that is literally playing as I sleep or music that I know very well. Once or twice an echoed word in a voice that sounds more like an idea of a voice than an actual person. Never human speech so clear and coherent that I thought someone was in my apartment. 
I’ve visually hallucinated children before. Once a little confused looking boy staring up at me from under my loft bed as a kid. Creepy af. And once an exceedingly evil looking little girl with black eyes and a serious need for some vitamin D. But they’ve been silent. 
I’m in my mid 20’s and don’t even KNOW any children. So this auditory experience really threw me with how strangely out of place it was.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi everyone!, i don’t really know if this is “sleep paralysis” but I think it is.

Alright now let’s start.

So for some context I think I was like..8(f)? And me and my mother and brother were staying at my great grandmothers place because we didn’t have a place to stay. 

So everything is normal we’re going to sleep. My mother and brother are sleeping and some reason the door is wide open and a bright light is shining through it.

All I see is a door shadow, all is well. So I shut my eyes and try to sleep. I wake up minutes later, door is still wide open with a light shining through it.

But I notice a weird shaped figure in the doors shadow. It had a head and long arms with long fingers.

The fingers of this “shadow” were moving like branches in the wind, like it was teasing me. 

Obviously I got scared and tried to go to sleep by just keeping my eyes shut. After awhile I finally fell asleep.

Sleepparalysis,"I'm not sure if this is sleep paralysis, but I couldn't think of anything else. I believe it began around when I was 12. I would fall asleep and commonly have typical nightmares of being chased. For most who've experienced the same usually would wake up once they got caught. But mine never ended immediately after getting caught. For example:

I vividly recall this dream of being in a movie theater or mall parking lot. I would be walking but always feel like I'm being watched. After a bit of walking, I would notice a figure with long hair, sort of like the grudge, and the chase would begin. After falling, I would get caught and would not be able to move at all. I would then begin to feel serious back pain every time I took a breath. The pain is like a painful muscle spasm. This feeling would last for what felt like 5 minutes.

I shrugged it off as a nightmare, but it still occurs today (6 years later). I usually have to same dreams every time it happens. The ""parking lot"" dream was the first one, and I had that same dream until I was 13. It then changed into me being in a room with a bed in the center facing a door that I could never open. But I never got chased in that dream. I just always felt stuck and felt the back pain ( I had this dream for about 3 years). In my most recent dream, I'm now in a house with a man. It goes on like a typical day of doing chores in the house and whatnot. And then I and the man end up in a parallel world in the same house. The only way I can escape is to find the key in the house, it's always in different places, and open the door before he can stop me. 

I don't know why I have these dreams but they are physically painful every time. It always occurs when I'm in a dream state, so it may not be sleep paralysis. But I can never move once I'm caught and the duration of me being stuck is getting longer and longer.

I get this happen to me some nights and it happened last night,  I go to fall asleep and I get like trapped in between like sleep and awake,  my face feels flushed for some reason my thumbs had these weird warm tingling sensation. And i had gusts of wind sound in my ears really loud, 

I knew I was falling asleep would have all these sensations star then wake myself up only for it to happen 3x every time I started to sleep.  

I also am like able to control what I'm doing like lucid dreaming? Like i think I'm going upstairs or getting up only to them wake up in my bed? I just get this like intense feeling a ghost or something is like watching me and it shivers my whole body as I try to fall asleep.

Sleepparalysis,"First I'd like to say I'm glad a subreddit exists for this. Hi I'm a 24 year old male and I've been having sleep paralysis for a long long time since I was a child I remember episodes happening when I was very young and thought it was something that happened to everyone, it's only later I found out it's not very common. Sleep paralysis for me is something I can never escape people say ""you are in control"" and whatever but every single time I experienced sleep paralysis or as an episode comes on I feel the same fear no matter what and I panic trying to escape that place, one time as a teen my brother actually intercepted and interacted with me during an episode apparently my eyes had no soul and I started to have convulsions as I was trying to regain control of my body during the late stage of an episode, that's when I knew my body was actually reacting because I used to think it was just dreams. So i can never get the strength to overcome it it's like it's just instinct to feel fear and if I look around my room I'm afraid I'll die if I see certain things because you never know what will be there that's how strong the fear is. This may sound ridiculous but I've created this fiction in my head that when I have an episode I'm in a sort of border world a parallel world that embodies my dark feelings in physical form. I guess it would make sense if I explain how an episode occurs first. So usually I hear an extremely loud vacuum like if a space ship was punctured and then I panic and I feel ominous presences around me and you feel them right next to me but I don't open my eyes, I've made that mistake before and I saw horrifying things and creatures one of them I've only seen once when the paralysis started again when I was about 20 he was a spider like being with a pulled back fact that exposed some if the muscle underneath his skin and his mouth was ripped off so he only had teeth showing and his eyes were tied shut and he had a black aura and was completely transparent in some areas , he stood over me and I knew I was dead but he didn't do anything for me but I thought I'd seen something I shouldn't have bare in mind this was the first time my paralysis happened in a long time since I was a child so I thought everything that was happening was real, the only reason I figured it was an episode was because in the paralysis my mind creates a perfect replica of my room but the windows was completely open and the curtains were going crazy and wind was gushing in but when I awoke my windows were closed, this wasn't a dream though I'm convinced it was a parallel world, i think these dark entities are drawn to people like me that have dark minds and are troubled and we are accidentally seeing them, I think everything in that world mirrors our own but looks completely different to them almost like a hellscape that we are tapping in to. I may sound crazy but this is really what I believe. So after that experience it started happening more but I never saw that thing again and I rarely opened my eyes again, I have so many stories it would be too long but I often hear voices cries of pain, and the most frightening ones is when it's my voice telling me things, it's a dark version of me that's full of malice and hate that wants me to give up and die he whispers that I'm a failure and I shouldn't exist. I often sense that beings are in the room and I have the usual symptoms like feeling weight on me. But sometimes it's terrifying because I sometimes forget it's a paralysis episode and I'll often be afraid for my life, it's very hard to sleep. And I wake up multiple times, I can get good nights sleep but it's like you never know when it's going to creep back I'm trying to change because I know it's tied to my dark mental state.

I screamed for my dad but I wasn’t aware I was in sleep paralysis so my voice was faint and my dad couldn’t hear me. It was trying to rape me. I thought I woke up at one point but I didn’t and I saw the shadow in my room and his face and claws around my neck. He just laughed as I screamed. I’m so scared and I don’t know what to do.

Sleepparalysis,"When I was in my early teens, I randomly got sleep paralysis once, and it began occurring once every few months or so....then it stopped. A decade later, I had only experienced it once or twice. I haven't had it since. I really don't think there was anything peculiar about those times when I experienced it. It seemed completely random.

It was always really frightening, though. I never witnessed any figure because I kept my eyes closed. I'm not sure if I even was able to open them. I didn't try. I remember it always beginning with me barely waking up from sleeping. Usually, when this happens, I might move an arm or roll to my side or something. However, I would try to do so and wouldn't be able to move. It started exactly like that the 10 or so times I experienced it. I would always freak myself out, thinking I would be unable to move forever. So I'd always have to wake myself up. I'd try focusing as hard as I could to move a toe or finger and think of whatever crazy thing I could come up with to get myself out of the sleep-state.

I often still wake up in this half-awake state in the middle of the night, and just simply roll over or squeeze the pillow or blanket that I'm probably spooning.

Sleepparalysis,"I barely ever get sleep paralysis, but when I do it’s always unnerving. I’ve heard stories about a man in a hat that people see during sp or when hallucinating on drugs, but I didn’t know it was so real. Yesterday I took a nap and it might have been the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced. I went into sp and saw my brother standing in the doorway with a plant talking to me. It was really odd but I couldn’t say anything to him. He walked away for a while and then the hat man arrived. There was a shadow man about 8 feet tall standing in the doorway. He had a flat brimmed hat and really long lanky limbs. As soon as I saw him, I felt like I was being strangled. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. He slowly crept to the edge of my bed and just stood there staring down at me. I tried very hard to move or make a noise. I felt like a large object was being forced onto my chest and I thought I couldn’t breathe.  I don’t know if I have ever felt so much fear and anxiety before. I thought I was going to die there.

Sleepparalysis,"I become aware of myself very easily in dreams so I’ve learned to have fun with it over the years. This particular night, I dreamt that I was riding around with my brother in his car. I realized that I was waking up, so I turned to my brother and asked him, “Will you drive me home? I’m waking up and I want to wake up in my body.” He said, “Yeah, sure.” Immediately my house was to our right and he pulled into the driveway. I walked up the steps to my porch and woke up right then. 

In an instant my eyes were open and I was laying in bed. Thankfully, I had fallen asleep with a pillow over my eyes so I couldn’t see anything. I could feel a presence looming over me though, and I assumed it was my roommate. I tried calling out for his help, but it didn’t work. Eventually I was able to throw the pillow off my head and wake up for real. My roommate was still asleep in bed.

Sleepparalysis,"I sometimes see sleep paralysis demons, but without the paralysis. Is this common? I know I'm not asleep. Since I can talk to myself, and I often stand up and go to the bathroom when I know that my brain is fully awake and the coast is clear. It's really weird, and I wonder if this is extremely rare. Or a very common thing, which is why I never hear people talking about it like this. 

Extra details: Most of the time, I see humanoid figures, often in a neon colored hue. Most often red. They don't act, they just look at me. I'm also never afraid during these attacks. I know they are a figment of my half sleeping brain, I'm not sure if that influences anything.

The next time I experience it, I'll stand up. Look straight at the demon and see what happens. But for now I'm afraid I can't give any more details about my variant of sleep paralysis.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi everyone, first time writing here.
Also, English is not my first language, sorry for any mistakes or weird phrasing.
So, I’ve been having sleep paralysis for some time now (7 or 8 years) and the nature of my sleep paralysis did change throughout the years but recently i started hearing really frightening and loud sounds.
It’s kinda weird and really disturbing because as most of you experience, I can feel when sleep paralysis is about to happen, and I can feel my brain literally building this really loud, high frequency noise. I don’t know if I’m explaining this right, but i can feel sound being built inside my brain and it getting louder and louder to the point where i get the feeling my brain is going to explode from it and of course I can wake up and I start loosing my breath, so yeah, it’s been pretty tense these last couple of weeks.

Sleepparalysis,"hi,

i’ve posted here once before, mostly seeking comfort because i was so genuinly terrified the first time i experienced sleepparalysis. i guess this is me doing it again, because i didn’t really think this was going to continue and now i’m really sad and scared on my own at night.

i’m also realizing that this has once again happened on a night where i’ve gone to bed super late, and i’ve been very stressed about multiple things. couldn’t fall asleep for a long time.

i’ll try and explain what happened:
this time felt more like a dream, but i’m sure it wasn’t. it’s a bit blurry, maybe because it just happened and i have a shit ton of adrenaline. i was lying in bed, and i had this constant feeling of not being safe. i was drifting in and out of this terrifying feeling. most of the time i laid completely still, with my heart racing, and i was trying to tell myself that ""i should be ok, why am i freaking out?""

like last time, i had a strong feeling that i wasn’t safe. someone was in the room with me. as i mentioned, i was fighting with my own brain the whole time because nothing was making sense. my heart would race, and then it would calm for just a few seconds.

then that absolute horrifying feeling- like someone sitting on top of my fucking chest. and i should mention! very random, but i was hearing voices the entire time. no idea what they said, UNTIL i felt that pressure on my chest. a voice was saying ""grandma"" repeatedly.

last time this happened i had my face burried in my pillow, facing the wall. even if i opened my eyes i wouldn’t have been able to see anything. this time i had the oppertunity, but knowing that people have seen demons and shit.. no, never in a million years.

it ended the same way it did last time, with me panicking so hard that i managed to force myself awake.

i feel a bit better now after typing that out, but still- how do people cope with this? i never thought this would happen to me.
i do fall asleep to true crime, but i have for years now and this has never happened. (don’t judge, yes i am the female stereotype) i’ve had a nightmare or two but nothing like this horrid crap. do i drink too much caffeine? sleep too late? stress too much?

do i play too much hogwarts legacy?

last time i fell asleep two hours after the incident, after laying in my own sweat, too scared to turn around in bed and get up to flip on the light switch.

Sleepparalysis,"A quick rundown of how my SPs usually play through, I'm interested in seeing if anyone else's experiences go down in this fashion. I'll be going step-by-step with details and descriptions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **The preface**, the preface for me is the moments leading up to this nocturnal terror. Usually a long run of staying up (abnormally long, 20 hrs+), or if I get *really* relaxed and lie down. So a recent **lack of sleep** or maybe REALLY allowing your back to sink into some soft sheets and a pile of pillows is a real trigger.
2. **The ""WTF""**, is the moment I'd be falling asleep, and some sly thought would stutter my sleep, and for a split second, the thought comes to my head...                                                                     ***""At least I'm not having sleep paralysis right now."" OR ""I bet I'm about to have sleep paralysis.""*** and in a trippy movie kind of way, my world slips me out of the box of comfort I'm in and my body stiffens up **OR** loosens up beyond my control, what I imagine being on heroin is like, reduced control, this is what I think begins the anxiety, the uneasiness of not controlling my body, knowing I can no longer *do* anything.
3. **The Flashing** is where things kick off. Whatever is visible becomes *not* and whatever wasn't visible now has a glossy, plasticky, soft glow. Like I'm in a doll house.. weird to read that, cuz I get stiff and my room gets ""doll-housey"", like I'm a doll. wild. But yes, my vision starts with this filter and everything around me starts to radiate with what seems like moonlight. With this comes many random audios, humming, frightening SFX, anything.
4. **The Beasts Of Maybeland** are what I call the entities that *maaayyyy* appear in my episodes. They do not always show, hence the maybe. Then, *if* they do, they don't always bother me, sometimes they'll just lurk around, outside of my vision, like they don't know I'm there, **OR** totally assault+battery+attempted murder combo me. They can look like anything. One looked like me, one was a group of old dudes, one was a mattress, and one was just a black cloud in my closet (there have been many more). MOTS, they're just ""wishy-washy"" like that.
5. **The Dream Montage** is a big maybe as well. Sometimes in my SPs, I have 0% control and just have to endure the attack or harassment. Other times I can force my muscles to move and in turn, wake me up by spamming the *do stuff* button. On the no-control occasions though, I may get forcefully sent into a trippy arse dream or fall asleep after and enter the same thing. Sometimes they mix as well. Like my sleep schedule gets directed by Stanley Kubrick every few days.
6. **The Last Part** means I have either successfully woken myself up or just gone thru something so terrifying it's impossible to forget.

* When I get stuck, I usually (instinctually) struggle to scream or breathe as loudly as I can to get someone to come to wake me up

Sleepparalysis,"I woke up in the middle of the night. I could see my bedroom, my hand in front of my face on the pillow, my cat sleeping next to my head as she often does. I could clearly feel the mattress beneath me, the blanket I was covered with. But I couldn't move. At all. And I thought to myself, 'alright, so I'm dreaming still? Except I'm definitely awake?'

And then *they* appeared. Probably four or five of them. Shadowy figures standing around the room. I could only see their silhouettes and I could feel them watching me. I looked at my cat again and thought, 'I'm definitely dreaming still. If I can just wake myself up, they'll go away.' Except I couldn't move, I couldn't speak, I couldn't do anything.

Now they were sitting along the edge of my bed. I still couldn't make out their features, but their faces were all toward me. And they started talking, all at once. *Scolding* me in a language I couldn't understand (which I later realized sounded a lot like people speaking backwards), but like a bad transmission through an old radio - all hisses and static and *anger*. I was still telling myself I was dreaming, but starting to feel doubt (I mean I was obviously awake, right?). And fear. I was aware of something looming in the open doorway, but I refused to look at it. The figures on my bed phased in and out but I could still hear them.

My perception of time during this whole episode is tricky, but it felt like a good five to ten minutes. Finally I was able to move my foot, barely, and after feeling pins and needles over my entire body, I was able to wake fully. Scrambled to turn the light on, hugged my cat... as you might imagine, it took me a long time to fall back asleep.

What the actual hell?

I used to have rather mild sleep paralysis as a teenager. The usual waking up, not being able to move, maybe a scary hallucination (but nothing this terrifying!). I don't think they ever lasted longer than a minute, if that. And I haven't experienced it in nearly twenty years. Spent the morning reading up on sleep paralysis just to calm my brain, and found this sub. Still feeling a little shaken, but hopefully writing it all out will help me get it out of my head.

It happened just as I would normally wake up.

I could not move.
I felt a presence and looked down.
I saw this massive being.

I felt awake and it appeared as if it really existed, and was in my room, in full detail.

It seemed feminine.
Its head reached almost all the way to the ceiling.
The hand was anatomically correct, but I didn't even try to draw it properly.
Its hair was thick and rope-like, not dreads.
The pupils had an odd, almost bottomless depth to them.
It was not looking at my face at first, but when I looked at it, its gaze shifted to me without moving its head.

It lasted maybe 6 seconds, I blinked just as its hand began to clench and then it was gone.
It was definitely frightening.
When it was gone I could move again.
I scrambled to turn on my lamp and looked around frantically, feeling a bit disoriented, but I was quickly able to rationalize it as not being real.

Sleepparalysis,"I fell asleep at around 11:40 AM, woke up at 12:07 because of sp. this was not like my usual episodes. This one was a lot more painful (especially for my head.) pressure was applied to my face, and it felt like it was being pushed and stretched out at the same time. I do not have audio or major visual hallucinations, but I do get physical hallucinations.

I’ve had plenty more, I just can’t remember them now. During this morning’s episode of sp, I felt so unaware of the upcoming sp. I have it so often that I am able to tell if I am going to get it and can wake myself up mid dream. I kept hallucinating that’s I broke out of it and crawled out of bed, but when I blinked, I was underneath my covers. This happened at least 4 times. I was getting desperate because my sp usually only lasts about 1 minute. I “scratched” my own leg to try to wake myself up, but I knew that’s impossible. I felt the scratch, but how did I feel it if I didn’t even scratch myself? This sp felt like it lasted 20 minutes, although that’s probably unlikely.

Sleepparalysis,"I've had multiple sleep paralysis in the past (being paralyzed, hardly able to breathe, not able to speak, nightmares/hallucinating, etc.). Most times it wasn't hard to free myself when I had one, I used all my strength to try and speak or move a part of my body. Almost every time the paralysis was gone immediatly.

But not this time. I am paralyzed, but able to breathe normally and I can talk, I also don't have nightmares, instead I have dreams where e.g. my sister walks into my room while I am in my bed, not being able to move. I can express the problem by talking to her and I can tell her that I need a moment to free myself somehow. We can communicate as normal but I am, as I said, paralyzed. It is almost the same dream over and over every time, just the people coming into my room vary.   
It is also way harder to free myself from the paralysis. As I said, I can talk, so that doesn't come in handy when trying to help myself out of the situation. I try to lift my arm(s). In some cases (when I put in a lot of effort) it even works. I lift them up, but they are still extremly heavy, so when they are back down, I still can't move. It needs multiple attempts until I can get out of the situation. If I fall asleep again directly afterwards, the same thing immediately happens all over again.

Sleepparalysis,"Since many people experience these things from SP I decided to post this here as some of you may know. 

From what I know, lucid dreaming is being aware you are dreaming, you can manipulate your dreams.

Astral projection is experiencing an out of body experience, when you leave your physical body you can see it lying down, you can float about but you aren't experiencing the physical world. You are experiencing the astral plane which is subjective to your own expectations. Apparently you can meet different entities here and open portals and whatnot? Correct me if I'm wrong.

Lastly, remote viewing is like astral projecting but you are in the physical world and you can see what is currently going on. So if your neighbours are currently watching TV, you will see them and the show they are watching.

I suddenly started to feel the tingles going up and down my body. I immediately know what it is, and say out loud (in the dream) ""I'm closing my crown chakra! I'm closing my crown chakra!"" 

I wake up from the dream and out of SP. I am honestly a little shocked it worked, but I can still feel a heaviness to my body.

Sleepparalysis,"TL;DR Typical sleep paralysis, then being dragged off my bed and bitten by my puppy, then dreaming of a sudden Bruno Mars concert at church.

**First time** I’ve experienced sleep paralysis while sleeping on my side - I’ve only ever experienced SP sleeping on my back and I’ve got nearly 20 years experience with SP. 

“Woke up,” (quotes because we know we’re not fully awake right?) couldn’t move, this is usually just annoying for me because I’ve learned to realize what’s happening almost right away.  But suddenly I’m being dragged by my legs toward the foot of the bed, so I’m trying to wake my husband up but of course I can’t make a sound. Then I reach down and our puppy is play-biting my hand, which is actually kinda comforting. Then I “wake up” again and I haven’t moved from the spot I’d originally “woken up,” puppy is presumably still sleeping soundly somewhere in bed, husband is fast asleep, I still can’t move but I just close my eyes and force myself back to sleep…

Then I dream husband and I are at a church event (husband and I haven’t been church-going people for a long, long time) with his parents (who are super into church stuff and excited we’re there). I notice my mom is sitting a few rows ahead of us and I feel bad that I’m not sitting with her. THEN - Bruno Mars. He comes strutting up to the stage singing the chorus of “Just The Way You Are” and the church congregation is LOUD singing along, jumping, the building is shaking, we can feel it in our chest. After the chorus Bruno quickly strolls back down the aisle to exit but I realize something’s off, he’s wearing a hat low over his eyes and looking at his feet as he leaves. I turn to my husband and say, “I don’t think that was even Bruno Mars,” but he’s like, “Where did my parents go?” We realize *everyone* older than us is GONE.

What does it mean? LOL thanks for coming to my… dream diary. I don’t remember my dreams often so maybe I’ll just record them here.

Sleepparalysis,"i have had sleep paralysis a lot lately. most of the time i simply can’t move and occasionally have the hallucination that someone is screaming at me or has run into my room. tonight was really different. i just woke up to post this.

i know i was dreaming but now i can’t remember what. i guess i “woke up” and then started experiencing sleep paralysis. the sound of soothing chinese music sounded like it was filling my room up. like someone was playing it on a “sleep time relaxation” video on youtube. it wasn’t scary at all, i was just extremely confused. i tried for about a minute to move and message my friend about it but i couldn’t. it didn’t hit me that it was a sleep paralysis hallucination until i was convinced it was paranormal activity and ran to google.

Sleepparalysis,"I have both sleep paralysis and sleep apnea. It can happen every day at its worst but normally once or twice a month. They happen at the same exact time so I'm paralyzed, blind, and unable to breathe. I sit in bed struggling to force myself up as I very slowly suffocate to death. Sometimes once I'm able to move I sit up and gasp for air. Other times however even when I can move an arm or two I can't wake up. I'll scratch at my face and attempt to open my eyes eith my fingers but nothing will work. Eventually once I lose all of my strength and feel as if I'm about to die I finally get set free and shoot straight up in bed. It often occurs after a vivid dream or nightmare and can happen several times a night. I get a rush of adrenaline every time but once I'm free I become completely calm all at once. I'm still unsure if someone or something other than myself can wake me up from this but I do find it very fascinating.

I can feel myself 100% wake, incredibly tired, then slip into this bizzare state where I am sleeping, but hear this incredibly loud static sound in my ears. I can also hear some sort of digital feedback. 
In this state, my eyes are shut. I dont hallucinate. I am lying down on my side like usual. However I am fully aware. The only thing that wakes me up is if I shut my eyes incredibly tight then force them open.

I was able to move my hands eventually and had to push the cloud off of me for the rest of my body to be able to move. before this when I was about to sleep I was feeling hyposensitive and was about to have a panic attack but somehow was able to stay calm. and the whole time I stayed calm. it was about 15 minutes,t2_4xrwtmcy,0,had the weirdest sp dream,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,113ngw3,True,random0_0reddit,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/113ngw3/had_the_weirdest_sp_dream/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/113ngw3/had_the_weirdest_sp_dream/,54207.0,1676543122,0,,False,1676543138,1676543139,2023-02-16 10:25:22,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"Had the most terrifying dream I've ever had after taking some Ashwagandha before sleeping. I've also been taking Lions mane and Moringa leaf daily along with the ashwa. It was one of those dreams that felt real where you could physically feel and sense things. I was laying in my bed and I could feel the household cat walk on my back, looked up at them and then put them down on the floor. Then all of a sudden I felt something else fuzzy the same size as a cat crawl on my back but it felt heavy and dark (As in my whole body could feel it's heavy dark presence) I could feel it emenating a dark energy as it crawled on my back, pure dread that was almost like static going through my body, like the whole atmosphere of the room went from normal to pure dread and nightmarish. 

This is where things really got terrifying and distrubing. I could feel it crawling up my back and then up to my neck where it layed/weighed down on the back of my neck put its mouth to my right ear and started to let out a deep consistant gutteral growl like it had its mouth wide open the whole time, I was too afraid to look up at it and I was frozen/paralyzed with fear. I ended up actually trying to scream for help almost in real life because it was making me literally cringe to the point where I was tensing up my shoulders towards my neck. I wanted it to get off of me but I couldnt because of being frozen in fear and then it ended. Most terrifying dream I have had hands down and it felt so real. It felt like what I imagine a black weasel wrapped on the back of your neck would feel like and the weight felt like a fire blankets heaviness if you have ever held one or covered youself with one.

I am a 28 year old man, no dreams or nothing usually scares me but this did. I've heard of people having sleep paralysis experiences and was skeptical until now.

This image is what I imagine/pictured was on my neck. I created this image through a word prompt ""Black demon sleep paralysis weasel"" which generated different A.I created images.

Sleepparalysis,"There's no doubt that sleep paralysis is a huge problem. I fear falling asleep knowing that I will wake up at night once again without being able to move a muscle as I hear screeches and shouting and as if someone is stomping up my stairs on their way to burst into my room. It's truly terrifying so I've been searching for a while on the Internet to find a way to stop this from happening. I found a research article that said that a certain frequency of between 426Hz and 438Hz of sound can help keep the brain asleep at night as well as help you keep your night time balance. So I started listening to sleep music and it actually works! Before I had sleep paralysis every 1-2 nights but once I started to listen to the frequency music I only have sleep paralysis only once every week! I don't feel as scared anymore to fall asleep and I'm sure as I continue listening to the magical music I will get sleep paralysis fewer and fewer times and maybe one day I won't ever get it again. So if anybody else needs some help on where to find this type of music then you can just search it up on YouTube. I have found a few examples in case you're not sure what to search for :

Sleepparalysis,"Last night I had my worst experience of sleep paralysis yet. I don't remember dreaming last night but I remember waking up, or so I thought to loud thundering booms, almost like nuclear bombs going off, one after the other. But I was stuck staring at the ceiling frantically trying to move my hand and whisper my girlfriends name. The booms were so loud that felt like they were shaking my entire house, in the moment I was literally thinking that I was going to be obliterated or pulverized by a bomb. Next thing you know (I must've fallen back asleep or passed out, no clue but my heart was fighting for its life) I'm on my stomach, with my arm hanging off the bed unable to move, yet again. This time there was no loud noises, but only a whooshing sound like someone was moving behind moving behind me, I felt like i was unable to breathe but I also felt like I was falling, it was an intense sensation. Then I awoke, on my back to my girlfriend asking if I'm alright because I was ""breathing like I was fighting my life and making whining noises.""

I was laying on my side and felt someone leaning on my back and felt someone looking over me to see if I was awake..? They whispered my name over and over and eventually I said FUCK that and since then if I wake up and can’t move I keep my eyes shut and deal with it.

It’s such a nasty feeling I wake up and it’s as if I’m laying there and something is pulling me through my mattress like arms just pulling my stomach down or I constantly feel pulling on my legs and always would wake up and my blanket would be across the room. So logically I couldn’t move so I’d close my eyes so hard and could feel the pressure on me and sometimes I was in actual pain and discomfort cause it was a regular occurrence for me to get messed with that way each time.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi there! I’ve been experiencing sleep paralysis for about 15 years. When it first started, it was infrequent- maybe once a month, and I was going through a period of stress and depression. For years, it would happen very occasionally. It has always been terrifying, but wasn’t disrupting my life more than the occasional night of troubled sleep. Recently, however, it has been happening more like 2-3 times per week. Every time it happens I can recognize it immediately, and while it’s still terrifying, I’m able to wake myself up faster than I used to be able to. (It’s still like a panic attack, but because I’m familiar with it, i can tell myself to wake up by clenching my fists more quickly than I could before). It has always been hard to tell how much time has passed, but I’m fairly certain that lately it only lasts 10-15 seconds. My biggest issue is that once I’ve come out of it, my body and mind are so on edge, that it will take hours for me to get back to sleep. I have slept through my alarm many times recently, probably due to a lack of sufficient sleep, during nights that sleep paralysis has disrupted my sleep pattern. I would like to think that I’m used to this enough that it shouldn’t prevent me from getting a full nights sleep, but I would be wrong. Has anyone had success getting a regular rem cycle during nights of sleep paralysis?

For context-
When I get sleep paralysis, lately it’s a sense of doom, inability to move, fast breathing, and terror until I’m able to move at least one body part. Sometimes I see things or hear things (always malevolent), and occasionally I feel things like a hand pressing my head against my pillow, someone sitting on or pressing against my chest, someone sitting on the bed next to me, or last night, something squeezing my hand. It has happened in the early morning, the middle of the night, but lately it’s more frequent just after falling asleep. I have heard auditory hallucinations, seen visual ones, but most often feel sensations of touch that aren’t there.

It makes sense to me that this would be more common during times of stress, but what type of doctor should I see about it?! Do i see my PCP? Therapist? Should I seek out a sleep specialist?

Sleepparalysis,"Hello,

I am a university student and Residence Don, I will sometimes take naps after my 8 AM classes to make up for lost sleep while on-call the night prior.

Often when I nap, I can feel my body begin to tingle, weight on my chest, and a rising loud ringing in my right ear as I drift off into sleep or while I’m in that “half-awake” state. While I am napping, I often feel that my limbs are being raised (proprioceptive hallucinations) and have vivid dreams, even weird ones that occur where I have fallen asleep as if I am awake. I am well-aware that these are characteristics of sleep paralysis. However, I thought it would be worth sharing since I’m curious why they are so strong when I nap versus when I sleep at night?

Sleepparalysis,"**Hey guys,**

I just wanna start by saying that i've had sleep paralysis for as long as I can remember. I'm 26 now for the age references, so it's been 6 years since i experienced these now. 

My terrors used to start as basic hallucinations of my favourite cartoon characters when I was younger, but as I got older they grew more and more horrific, which caused bad sleeping problems. The last 3 times I remember were the hardest ones I had, and I haven't slept on my back since, which has luckily has stopped them and I wish to never have it again.

&amp;#x200B;

3rd to Last One; The time I got dragged; age approx 16-17

This one started as usual, with the pressure change and the ears rumbling. I opened my eyes to expect the see the usual horrors, but instead it was just my room. This particular time, I had fallen asleep on my back but with my head turned to the side, away from the wall that my bed was against, so I was facing out into my room. As I closed my eyes, I tried and focus on falling asleep properly so I could wake up and turn over so I could get out of the SP. I suddenly had that eery feeling that someone was in front of me as the air in front of my face changed to a warmer feeling. I was too scared to open my eyes, so I kept them shut, which made the rumbling louder in my ears. Slowly, I felt something grab my wrist, and i could physically feel my arm moving out to the side of my bed; it felt like a warm, human hand. I was again, too scared to open my eyes, so I just hoped it would stop soon and I could wake up. It didn't stop and i felt the cold air under my arm as it got dragged off the bed completely and I was starting to get dragged under the bed. The moment I opened my eyes is the moment I felt my upper body and shoulder start to move as my arm had fully gone under the bed. As I opened my eyes, I saw the pitch black dark face of something move under my bed where my arm was being dragged, it's hand going down with it, and it's hand was long and sharp. It had glowing eyes and a disgusting creepy smile as it went down. I think the pure panic woke me up properly, where I noticed my arms were still where they were when I had first gone to sleep, but I couldn't shake the feeling of how real it was.

2nd to Last One; The time I got physically picked up and moved out of bed; couple weeks after the one above

The one again started as usual, with my head facing the ceiling, lying on my back. As the pressure changed and the rumbling began, I remember specifically telling myself not to open my eyes, as that's when the horrible stuff started. So I kept them shut and tried to ride out the auditory hallucinations. The auditory ones would usually be painful screaming that is louder than what your ears can hear, it's like it's taking up every inch of space on the planet with how loud it is, like the noise can explode your brains. As I tried to ride it out, i felt myself becoming more weightless than usual in a SP state. I opened my eyes and noticed the ceiling was getting closer and closer. I had glow in the dark stars on my ceiling so I could tell the depth. As I got a fair distance away from my bed, I only then realised I was being moved out of my bed completely. I saw the stars start to shift to the side as I was being carried sideways towards my bedroom door. I closed my eyes and again, hoped it would stop soon and that I would wake up in bed. I felt the shift in direction again as I'd reached near a wall and I was starting to be lowered. It was incredibly slow moving, and my body felt similar to what it feels like being in an elevator, when you can feel when it stops and starts. My heels touched the ground first, then I felt heavy again as my bum, then back then head all touched the ground. I physically felt all this in my body as I lay on my carpet. The hardness of the surface really felt like my floor as opposed to the bed i'd just come from. This one took me a while to bring myself out of as I was so scared from the experience. I remember saying to myself in my head ""If you're on your bedroom floor, then something bad has happened"". I slowly and shakily opened my eyes, to my absolute relief I was still in my bed in the position i fell asleep in. I felt my weight come back and my hearing came back to normal as I woke up properly. I didn't go back to sleep again that night and this was the last one I had for a while after as I stopped sleeping on my back. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Last one I remember having; Auditory Wars; aged 20

I was in my first year of uni and hadn't long started, so I think this one was stress related. I refused to open my eyes for this one, and actually didn't open my eyes throughout the entire thing, so it was all auditory. It started out with the rumbling, but that turned into what I can only describe as native american war calls(?) I honestly have no other words in my vocabulary to describe what I was hearing. It again, filled the entire space in my brain so it's all I could hear, even though hearing isn't the right sensation to describe it either. In the distance I could hear a plane, but I thought that was in real life and thought I was coming out of it. Under the plane noise, I could hear distant booms with it too. The plane noises grew louder and louder as did the booms, until eventually, I could hear nothing but loud booming and crashing as if bombs were being dropped right on us. The war calls were still happening too. Under my closed eyes, I could see flashes of orange and yellow. As this point, even if i wanted to open my eyes, I couldn't; they were glued shut. I don't remember coming back out of this one, I assume I just fell asleep and rode it out until my body returned to normal sleep. But this was the last time it ever happened and the volume of it isn't something I can ever forget. Life has always felt off since these stopping, i don't know how to describe the feeling.

Sleepparalysis,"So I've had this recurring thing for a few months and I'm not sure what to make of it. I don't think it fits the traditional definition of sleep paralysis either, but I'm not sure what else it would be.

It happens most often when I wake up in the middle of the night or before my alarm typically wakes me up. When I try and go back to bed, something strange happens. I have tinnitus so my ears have a low ringing in them most of the time, but when I try going back to sleep it gets really loud and intense. I also can't move when this happens, but I can visualize myself flailing around, and eventually, that will allow me to move around again. However, when I lay back down this process often repeats itself and I get stuck in a cycle. 

I'm not entirely sure what to do about it. Obviously, it can't hurt me but it still feels freaky. Trying to move makes me panic, but trying to stay still and go along with it also freaks me out as well. I also sometimes get visual hallucinations from them, but they have a wide range of intensity.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello everyone! For the past year or so I have been having some issues around sleep and was hoping someone could provide some insight. (I suffer from OCD and anxiety, not sure if that plays a role here)

Occasionally, like maybe once every few months or so, I have a really weird experience when waking from sleep. This is typically very early in the morning, like between 4am and 6am. I will wake up and everything just looks *off*. Like my limbs feel far away and foreign and my vision is strange, like the framerate is wonky and everything is moving too fast and jittery. It feels very out of body. I also feel very foggy and slightly confused when this happens, though I still have ""normal"" cognitive ability and everything. It sends me into a panic and I immediately get up and move around and it goes away. It has never lasted more than a minute or so and goes away once I feel fully ""awake"". Perhaps the strangest thing is I will sometimes experience this in my DREAM right before waking up. Like the same visuals and bodily sensations. I have had plenty of lucid dreams before as well.

I will include that during periods of very high anxiety, I have auditory hallucinations when on the brink of falling asleep that startle me awake. It is always a loved one saying something. Occasionally I will even half dream / half imagine my mom or partner hugging me while half asleep and then realize it didn't happen. Again, this is only during periods of frequent panic attacks and major stress.

I have severe health anxiety and have spent so much energy trying to figure out what is happening here. I am stuck between DPDR and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, but feel like neither fit? 

Before anyone asks, I have spoken with my doctor and psychiatrist. And I don't plan on doing a sleep study because this is so infrequent that the odds of catching it are too slim.

Sleepparalysis,"I was taking an afternoon nap and then i started dreaming about me being back at my house and my parents going out for a few days, so i hosted a house party with my sister. But they came back and all my friends had to leave and we fought a lot. That was around 8 PM, around 12 my father asked me if i had anything to eat i said i didn't. He said it's okay, go get something and gave me his car keys. 

I went down and ordered an uber taxi, for some reason Uber sent a Bus. Like 40 people sitting capacity bus, the guy then told me in a really sweet way that it happened because he's the only driver available. We then started going, i was showing him the way and then halfway through i realised oh fuck my father gave me kar keys. 

So i asked the Bus Driver to turn around and take me back, i forgot to tell him about a u turn and there is a confusing turn near my house at which i also gave him the wrong direction, so fed up of this he asked if i wanted to drive. It was a simple way so i thought sure, I could drive a bus home.

 Accidentally i took a wrong turn and we ended up in traffic and roads too narrow for a bus, i asked the Bus driver to drive to get us out of there. He got mad and asked me to leave, which i did because i was already embarrassed enough. 

So i got off and then was walking down a road and i started feeling like i was unbelievably drunk out of my senses, unable to walk straight because of it i went off course and fell into a sort of an open sewer sludge container. 

I reach with my feel to push back but my legs don't move, i reach out my hands by my hands refuse to move too, i try to call out for help and i can't say anything. I slowly sink to death in a vat of sewage sludge.

Sleepparalysis,"I have frequent sleep paralysis episodes, usually 10 or so times a year, but this one was different.

They happen often enough that I generally remain calm and either ride it back to sleep or wake up in shock. Today my wife and I were watching the superbowl on the bed and I fell asleep. Probably due to the noise I woke up in a sleep paralysis state and I can see and hear the game playing. My wife also took a phone call and I remembered the details to that too (she later confirmed).

But this was like a sleep paralysis limbo, I couldn't shake it, and it felt like I was stuck there for an eternity. Eventually panic starts to kick in and that noise, like you can hear static when yawning, started getting louder and louder. The panic manifested spirits around the room and of course the panic was getting the best of me and as the illusion spirits got closer the noise got louder.

My brain told me I needed to fight it so I had a moment of concentration where the noise stopped, but then it dropped like a dubstep bass. It just blew out blasting static noise and I can remember all the spots around my brain lighting up like small fire spots. I blanked out the rest of the memories but my wife woke me up because I started convulsing. When she woke me up she let me know I stopped.

This is when I was able to confirm everything that happened during the long sleep paralysis episode. Thanked my wife and let her know I was actually having a sleep paralysis episode.

Sleepparalysis,"I have sleep paralysis but had one very strange and different experience than normal and I’m wondering if anyone wants to give some science-y insight or maybe it’s just one of those glitch in the matrix ordeals. 

Anyway I woke up in the middle of the night as per usual and was looking out my window. While I’m casually looking out the window I go to stretch for a yawn and started lifting my shoulders and arms up a bit. And then mid stretch/yawn - suddenly the window and my bedroom are lit up. I can hear birds. And then I realized it had actually just became morning but in an instant. Like snap of my fingers. My eyes never left the window and I never closed them, not even to blink. I was still in mid stretch. Couldn’t believe it. I was shook man. 

The only thing I can compare it to is the rare times where I’d obviously fallen asleep with my eyes open and I’ll dream while they’re open/see things visually if you know what I mean.

Sleepparalysis,"I've been having what seems to be sleep paralysis for most of my entire life. I've never seen a doctor for it, but I've definitely identified the trigger as napping during the daytime. I am not one to get sleepy during the day, but occasionally I'm able to drift off when the mood is fitting. What's odd to me, is that mine is 100% controllable. As I start to get sleepy and drift off, I will hear this rumble in my ears. At first it will be a quick ""BMMM"" as I describe it, almost being a warning of ""Hey, you're about to feel like you can't breath"". if I choose to open my eyes I'm back to where I started. If I do not, the rumbling will get longer and longer, until it takes hold and I'm basically paralyzed. If I notice it quick enough I can force my arm to move enough to snap out of it. If I do not, then I will feel as though I can't breath (I understand this is a result of the chemical release and I am actually still breathing) and am unable to move. I can almost do this on command when I'm in the moment to nap, choosing to either let it happen or not. 

I've been pushing it lately, almost as a game to relax and enjoy the lucid dreams that I have regularly when I'm not having sleep paralysis. This has never happened at nighttime when I normally go to bed. I've had lucid dreams since I was a child, but the few times I've drifted off with the paralysis my dreams are 100% controllable and I can remember smells, textures, tastes and sounds much more vividly than the normal choppy dreams I have. I've been following r/earrumblersassemble  for a while as I'm one of them, and the sound heard when my ""sleep paralysis"" is coming on is the exact same as performing the rumbling.

Sleepparalysis,"I've had sleep paralysis a ton, and even a year of my life where I had it every day, they're usually positive experiences. I know how to ease out of it and wake up/go back to sleep. I've never had a scary sleep paralysis experience until today. I was taking a nap beside my boyfriend while he was working on his computer. I kept waking up periodically and going back to sleep, but the last time I went to sleep before the experience I had a dream where I was running away from a killer and I hid under the bed and I saw the person's feet in front of me, about to look under the bed. I thought I had woken up but soon realized I couldn't move. So usually how my sleep paralysis goes like this: eyes open, can't move, can't speak, no scary (specific) hallucinations or visions. This time when I woke up and all went as usual, I couldn't move or speak and I was seeing the room around me. But I heard sounds in my ears that almost sounded like white noise, but like whispering. The only whispering I could make out was ""run"" and ""we can see you"". At this point, I'm just trying to wake up, and I tell myself to relax and focus on *actually* waking up. I try to take a deep breath in and it was almost like I forgot to breathe. No air was going through my nose at all. For some reason, all I could do was exhale and take any short breaths through my closed teeth. I remembered that my boyfriend was beside me and I somehow started making noise through my teeth. He thankfully woke me up and it felt as if I breathed for the first time. This freaked me out since I've never had sleep paralysis like this before, it just felt too connected to my dream and overall some weird auditory hallucinations.

Sleepparalysis,"Yeah it sounds like clickbait but it's genuinely the most terrifying experience ever. 
So basically I was dreaming, and what happens to me quite a lot, is that when I turn lucid aka realise I'm dreaming I wake up and am in sleep paralysis. I'm pretty used to sleep paralysis at this point, so I have a decent grip over my thoughts so I don't Starr hallucinating bad stuff.
What happened a few minutes ago though is just absolutely terrifying. So I became lucid in a dream and I woke up because I'm not able to really control that yet and like clockwork I was paralysed. No problem I'll wait it out no need to panic. I wake up, literally blink, and I'm lying on the bed again, paralysed. I remember sort of thinking it was funny because I thought I was in a dream inside a dream. But then it happened again. And again. And again. I eventually started panicking and fighting the paralysis(if I try really hard I can move some parts of my body and inflict pain on myself to speed up the paralysis process) and I was absolutely terrified. I still couldn't think straight since well I was not fully awake. Eventually after what seemed like forever it stopped and I woke up, feeling different from the other times. Still paralysed, and after that was over I actually woke up and didn't go back to paralysis after blinking.

What my theory on what happened is that I was dreaming about sleep paralysis and it turned into a nightmare about sleep paralysis. Don't know though but still terrifying as fuck and I still am not sure if I'm awake, but hopefully I am.

Sleepparalysis,"hey guys,

I'd like to apologize at first, I'm not a native English speaker. so, if some sentences or words don't make sense, don't wonder.

last week, I think that I had something like a sleep paralysis. since it happened, I often think about it and I just want to share it with some people, because it was very frightening.  


here's the story:  
at that evening, I had a long phone call with my partner. we have a long distance relationship and we call each other every evening.

that specific evening, it was a very long conversation, until 1 in the morning.

we hung up and I slept immediately, because I was so tired. but then, like 5 or ten minutes later, my boyfriend was on the phone again (on loudspeaker) and he asked me: ""hey, are you awake?"" and I was like: ""yea, now I am. why are you still on the phone?"" and then he told me, that he couldn't sleep and I was confused, because I was very sure that we hung up minutes before.  
but I continued talking to him, didn't know the subject, but I remember that we talked again.  
and then, there was a moment, when my room got completely dark and the phone went off. it happened with a noise, that I know from apocalyptic movies. sounded like a big power plant Is shut down, if you know what I mean.  
next thing I remember, that I have tried to turn on my phone again and I didn't work. the darkness was very scary, because there wasn't any light source from my window or any other thing that I could notice in my room.  
suddenly, something/someone grabbed my hair and pulled me towards the foot of my bed. I thought ""F\*ck, someone has broken into my home"".  
He or it wrapped me in my blanket and than squeezed the sh\*t out of my body. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't scream. nothing.   
I tried to push against it, but it/he squeezed my body so much, that I couldn't move. I was panicking and had I dialog with myself, in which I tried to figure out how to behave. I wasn't sure if I should keep trying to do something and hopefully defend myself or if I should stay calm to not make the perpetrator more aggressive.  
after a few minutes, the squeezing stopped and I was free. I unwrapped myself and searched my phone in the dark, to turn on the lightening, but I didn't find it. then I staggered in daze to the light switch and turned on the lights. no one was there. I took my phone and realized that my boyfriend didn't call me for a second time and after the time stamps in our messages and phone list, it was like one hour since we hung up. that don't made sense for me, because in my memory, we talked 5 minutes before the whole situation happened.  
I wrote him and he was still awake, called me and reassured me and he confirmed, that we hung up and then did not talk again.  


the whole thing was so scary and today, I'm afraid to sleep, because I have to think so much about it. no one was in my apartment, besides myself. but I felt how someone was grabbing my hair, squeezed me with his arms, wrapped me in the blanket. I never have done something like that myself.  


I think it was a sleep paralysis, otherwise I have to assume that it was something paranormal and I don't want that. 

So, it was my experience.

Sleepparalysis,"Sorry if my grammar is bad but I really need help. I'm very confused if what's happening to me is sleep paralysis and things like that or if I'm having seizures
Yesterday when i went to sleep kinda early I woke up at 3 am. Not really rare I wake up in between 1-4 am when I fall asleep early.


 Okay so i was scrolling a bit on my phone and all that and then I decided to lay down a bit. I was just staring at the door in my room and my eyes were half closed and suddenly I could hear my heart beat like it was extremely loud. My view began to change from my door to like a dream. This isn't the first time it happened, another time I was doing the same thing staring at a door and all of a sudden its like a dream started ""playing"" while my eyes were open. One moment there was my room and the next there was a dog on top of me that wanted to bite me. I get kinda panicky at these moments which is why i always wake up instantly. But when I do it's like I'm in a completly different room and i cannot recognise it but it's like my brain does so I kinda just lay there until it goes to my like original room. 


Anyways so yesterday as It started to change I could feel as if something was punching me, it was like something was punching me or putting pressure on me everytime my heart beat. It was literally going through my whole body. So I like woke up instantly,I calmed down and turned on the side and closed my eyes. Now this is what I'm concerned about, When I closed my eyes I got a feeling as if something walked into my room and was very close to me, like watching me right next to my bed. Then my heart started beating again but it was like it was literally in my ears, my body was getting hotter and like I said it was like lighting was spreading through it, I could hear music and multiple voices, they were pretty loud. Honestly I was extremely scared cuz I had no idea what it was I though something was gonna eat me. It went on for about 10-15 seconds until I decided im just gonna open my eyes, and so I did. Nothing was there, yes i could move but I literally moved slightly and the next thing i know, I felt like i lost all ability to move in my limbs. I was on my back and I was looking at my door again , in the corner there was a shadow moving, It's like I wanted to move but I had no strength. I was looking at my arms and wondering why the hell I wasn't moving. This also lasted 10 seconds until I was finally able to move. 


Something similar to this ALSO happened before. I was thinking about another universe in my head yk I had powers and all that shit I do it whenever I wanna fall asleep and at some point. My body got that feeling of literal lighting going through me, I was shaking, I could hear music in the background and I saw flashing lights. Except that time I was not scared, I was excited. I thought maybe I went to that universe but the feeling was kinda overbearing and I decided to open my eyes.

Sleepparalysis,"Think it was in the middle of the night, I was first having a dream where I was working as some random employee in a food factory. Then, all of a sudden — almost like I was kicked out of that dream, I was present in my bedroom.

For some reason, I could see behind me and was basically aware of the entire space around me, even though I was sleeping facing the wall.

Shortly after that, I would see a tall, lanky, faceless dark figure in the opposite corner of the room. At first it wasn’t doing anything, just standing there.

After a brief moment, it suddenly started moving super erratically. Its limbs were stretching and shortening, being thrown about all over the place, sticking to the ceiling and what not.

As it came over to me, it started breathing down on my neck. And later, my ear.

It didn’t have eyes or a face, but it felt like it was giving me the nastiest evil grin I’d ever seen in my life whilst staring directly into my soul.

The feeling was even worse: it felt like I had an elephant pressing down on my body, and I couldn’t for the love of me scream or punch the thing. At first, my body went into freeze mode and just stopped all of its functions, and my heart was beating super loud.

With immense effort, I somehow managed to throw my fist into the air and let out a brief whimper in an attempt to shout.

Was one of the worst experiences I ever had. Contrary to popular belief, SP from firsthand experience isn’t some cool insomniac quirk, it’s a dreadful sensation.

Sleepparalysis,"I've been up late for many consecutive days and it seems like that worsens my condition. 
It happened right after I had gone to sleep. I instantly opened my eyes to witness a black figure jumping from a higher ground to my bed and I seemed to have the perfect look in that direction. 
My brain first thought of it as my brother as his height would also resemble the figure, but my brother was sleeping beside me which came to my knowledge right after it jumped and when I looked over. I don't remember much but after it landed, I seemed to lower myself on the pillow to slowly close my eyes and weird darkness started to block my vision. I woke in the morning like nothing happened.

I thought to myself that this was my last chance and I can’t die like this .

Sleepparalysis,"Hey all, I’m not super new to sleep paralysis but I’m new to the sub. I’ve never had any truly terrifying experiences with it like seeing shadows or feeling pressure or anything like that. The first time it happened I was already aware of what sleep paralysis was so it was more annoying than anything. Now at this point I get it from time to time but what I’m curious about is that they’ve kinda evolved. Now whenever it happens, I “wake up”, can’t move and eventually after struggling to move for a while I’m like “oh we’re doing this again”, so I wait it out only to “wake up” again in a loop for many many cycles of that. Eventually I can figure out oh I’m still dreaming, this isn’t the real one back to sleep, but that doesn’t necessarily end the loops, I just gotta keep going deeper til I wake up for real. At this point my sleep paralysis is more of an inconvenience than anything but I’m just wondering if anyone else experiences this kinda sleep paralysis and how to potentially break out of it?

Sleepparalysis,"What is sleep hygiene and how is it provided?
Sleep hygiene is all of the recommended behaviors and environmental factors that affect your sleep in order to improve your sleep quality. After evaluating your sleep disorder, your doctor will give you information about some behavioral recommendations and precautions. If you still have sleep problems after 4-6 weeks despite these precautions and behavioral changes, it would be beneficial to consult your doctor or a sleep center.

Sleepparalysis,"First off I get sleep paralysis a lot (and lucid dreaming/sleep paralysis mixture too)

Sometimes tho I get something I’m not sure if it’s related to sleep paralysis or not, but I’d be mid sleep and dazed/foggy minded and notice I’ve been rigidly stiffening up a certain limb of mine (elbow, ankle etc..) like I’m waking up and sleeping and feeling it all together (very distorted consciousness) 

When I go to move that body part it hurts so bad cause it was stiffened extremely and the pain keeps me going back and forth from dream to awake in my room.

Sleepparalysis,"I've been having sleep paralysis every time I fall asleep in the afternoon or daytime for the past year.
When it started i was scared but i tried to get used to it thinking it would stop after some time.
I had no sleep paralysis demon, It was different fucked up  scenarios that played out each time and it included normal people from my life around me

.For instance i had this one where my mother sat down beside me while I was paralysed and started to break my fingers. It hurt and I woke up conflicted.(may be due to unresolved trauma with my family)

What freaks me out is how my brain conjures scenarios that I would have never thought of in my daily life just to scare the shit out of me

I stopped sleeping in the daytime completely and it did in fact help until recently where i go to sleep at night and have dreams about it. Dreams about being paralysed in my sleep

My roommate was on the top bunk and I tried to call for her help but couldn’t. I was looking around and I can see everything in my cell, pictures I’ve hung on the wall but I’m paralyzed even felt like it was hard to breathe… then a guard comes in and drops her keys and the loud sound woke me up finally and I was normal again.

Sleepparalysis,A few years ago I started getting really vivid dreams and occasionally nightmares. I'd wake up after these dreams with anxiety. I also get random or loud thoughts just before falling asleep. I've also had dreams start shortly after falling asleep. I feel kinda tired after dreaming so much at night. Since I was hearing things I thought something was seriously wrong. I go to see a regular doctor and he doesn't seem to think anything is wrong. I decided to get a second opinion through a place that treats mental health. They really didn't think it was a big deal and just said try to reduce stress. My stress was coming from these sleep issues. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I've thought about this being hypnagogic hallucinations.

Sleepparalysis,"I have been having these weird experiences off and on lately. 
It happened again tonight. 
So, I was asleep and I couldn't breathe. I was dreaming that our 8 y/o son, our 6 week old puppies, and one of those corgi pups that was now a big blue heeler were all piling on my chest. 
I felt like I was really suffocating. I was so scared. I couldn't move at all. 
I was trying so hard to take a breath but I couldn't take anything more than a tiny shallow breath which I read is because you're in REM and you're breathing is low and shallow still even though you're awake and want to take a deep breath which in turn causes panic. 
I couldn't open my eyes, though, so all of this that I was seeing was a dream and not a hallucination I think. 
Thankfully, my husband was awake and asked if I was OK. I could barely speak. It felt like my mouth was heavy. I said that I couldn't breathe or move. He pushed me upright, and I slowly regained my composure and was then able to open my eyes, breathe, and move. 
Could this be sleep paralysis? It's not like all the scary stories I've heard on YouTube about people laying there with eyes open and seeing demons or witches climbing from the bottom of their bed to their chest. 
I could not open my eyes. I tried. 
It was so weird. 
It's been happening every couple of weeks with slightly different dreams each time. 
I imagine it's stress. 6 puppies, being a full time student, wife, mother, and making sure my families needs are taken care of, along with my female dog having health issues where she now needs surgery, my sons sports twice a week, homework from his private school which we are all getting used to the new expectations of, and home renovations where most of the work is done by us to save money would be a lot for anyone to take on. 
I'm fine with my stress usually. I handle my life well, so it's weird that it would cause me to all of a sudden start having sleep paralysis at 32 when I've never experienced anything like this prior to this period in my life.

i'm also curious about the cause of my hallucinations. they're only auditory ones. they can be voices or sounds that trigger my anxiety. idk what sleep paralysis hallucinations come from though so that's why i'm not sure what link to make. if it helps, i struggle with processing noise a lot (haven't been diagnosed with anything). and i kinda need help when i get sleep paralysis. i'm always aware that the noises are hallucinations, but they still give me so much anxiety. i know how to kinda prevent sleep paralysis for me, so i'm only asking for help with what happens when i get it.",t2_qh3lroui,0,experience with sleep paralysis,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,10tveup,True,snshinerai,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10tveup/experience_with_sleep_paralysis/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10tveup/experience_with_sleep_paralysis/,54127.0,1675555272,0,,False,1675555287,1675555288,2023-02-05 00:01:12,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"I've experienced sleep paralysis twice in my life, recently I had my second episode and it was fairly traumatizing. To preface, my best friend recently killed himself and I've been feeling intense remorse and guilt for not being there for him in the way that I probably should have towards the end. Of course, these feelings are what I assume brought on the experience.

In the last year, we grew apart. He was an avid dug user and was involved with some violent people - I had just started working full time and was actively trying to move away from that lifestyle. I tried my best to help him, but there's only so much you can do for someone before it starts to negatively affect your own life. Anyway...

The other night I was sleeping on my stomach. I remember waking up to my bedroom door opening, and I could hear someone enter and start walking slowly towards me with heavy boots. I knew instinctively that it was him from the sound of the timberlands he would always wear. He stepped up onto my bed and climbed onto my back until I could feel heavy pressure on my chest from the force of his weight. I felt his hands wrap around my neck as he began strangling me - I tried to scream and shake him off but my body wouldn't respond. I could sense his hatred for me. With time, I slowly began to wake and he seemingly disappeared.

I've been scared to sleep ever since this experience. But there's a certain part of me that feels like I deserve to feel like shit for not being there for my friend in his time of need.

Sleepparalysis,"I was sleeping on a single bed alone, listening to sleep music (which is usually on a 20 min timer to stop after that.) It was 1:20 am and I'm facing left towards my bedside table. 
All of a sudden I was shaking a bit, only my head. I was half awake and felt a person's lip on the right side of my neck. My body then gave me the option to wake up fully but I kept myself in a state where I could see where this would go.
Side note: I've had SP but have always wanted to see it or experience it again.
Anyways I chose to let the thing keep touching my neck but here's the problem. My head, neck and shoulders continued to shake but this was more vigorous. While the shaking was getting more and more violent I could feel the person's lips on my neck more clearly... I could also feel the rest of the head as well as a hand holding me. 
Then at one point the shaking was so bad I felt like something would happen to my body and I sort of woke up fully. Not really wake up but everything stopped. The person dissapeard, like I didn't feel anything and my shaking stopped... I still shook a bit from a slight sacredness and I could still feel the lingering touch on my neck even a day after.

Sleepparalysis,"It was a fine midnight, I was watching and scrolling through TikTok. for straight 3 hours, I was in my bed lying down watching some old videos from 1800's because I was genuinely interested in fashion taste of the century of 1800's. To cut to the chase, I fell asleep around (Falling asleep unknowingly is the best sleep Imo.) 12 am. then, I woke up, my eyes were blurry as hell, and wasn't even fully open, but I can see my lamp and my ceiling, so I know I woke up. When I tried to move, I could not, but it felt like I was moving but really, my hands were not moving. My chest also felt heavy. Thats when I knew I'm experiencing it.  


There were creepy kind of like screeching, intensifying noise that I can hear in both of my ears, and I can see a skull, as if it was falling towards me. With the noise and my weird illusion, I fought to it and like I shoved it. I suddenly moved, and it all came to me that I had a Sleep Paralysis. I went out to drink some water, it was already 4 am in the morning. which is my wake-up time. Went to work, like nothing happened, well I didn't think much of it.  


The second time was just 3 days ago, except it's the same. but I did not see any weird illusions or hear any weird sounds. just felt heavy and could not move. and again, did not think too much of it.  


the third time was just this afternoon, I fell asleep in the living room watching TV, my brother was there. I was on my back. when I woke up, I could not move again. I also hear like, weird kind of like Demonic laughing (That could not be my brother, he was watching and wouldn't just scream like that), at the same time I hear screaming pain as if they were in extreme pain. My back felt so heavy. I was going to touch my brother, but I just could not, I cannot move. Now, this is my mind since that happened this afternoon. I'm kind of scared to sleep tonight.  


Well, yeah. Most of the time, I don't sleep. that might be the culprit on why I am experiencing this shit. Or could it be there's a meaning to this? fuck no.

Sleepparalysis,"Some of the SP experiences are a lot like the one I had last night.
I woke up and realized I couldn’t move my head. It was heavy like it was bolted down or weighed a ton. I could tense and get my head shaking and I could slowly twitchily move my legs and hands. I had kicked blankets off of me and tried to scoot myself off the bed. However, my limbs didnt feel real. Yet I could not get my head and neck to cooperate. What was weird was that my breathing was unhindered. I could only breathe through my nose and what was stuffy when I went to bed was clear during this experience.
I tried not to panic but these episodes seem to get a little longer each time. And I try to keep calm about how this may be the time I don’t come out of it.

As a result, my father called out to me. I will be able to move and took a step back, but the room was already empty. I don't know what it was. And the last case was recently after the operation, I had a fight with the doctors and I was sent home. I decided to sleep on the train. after a while I woke up but I couldn't move and someone in my legs started growling at me. I immediately realized that it was sleep paralysis. The fear began to grow, but I quickly suppressed it and mentally said ""don't growl at me.""  The fear immediately disappeared and I woke up in a couple of seconds. The sleep paralysis itself lasted about less than a minute. I believe that I sold his fear because my life over the past six months has been scarier than some kind of ""sleep paralysis"".

Sleepparalysis,"Hello everyone, I'm a long time sufferer of sleep paralysis and insomnia. I was chatting with my mom this morning, who also has insomnia (but not sleep paralysis) about getting hallucinations when you're sleep deprived. I jokingly said ""whenever I start seeing the sleep spiders, I know it's time to go to bed,"" and she looked at me like ??? What are you talking about ??? I tried explaining it to her, but she said she never experiences this. 

I always start to see spiders crawling out of the corners of my eyes, but when I look at them, they're not actually there. It'll happen a lot, and they look exactly how spiders look when they're crawling just out of sight (I've been startled by a real spider more than once because just assume they're hallucinations until I actually look at them, lol.) I know about the phenomenon a lot of people experience when they first wake up and see spiders or other hallucinations, but this always happens when I'm already awake/have been for a while.

Sleepparalysis,"From reading some posts it looks like some people do not like SP. I wonder if it's because some people don't know how to wake up from it. I can't find many posts about waking up so thought I'd post my technique. 

Once I figured out how to wake up I enjoyed SP. 

To wake I'd just force push all my muscles with my mind. I'd think about pushing all my body's muscles to move and it would eventually move and that forces me out of It. 

Imagine being paralysed and awake, which you are, but imagine trying to lift your arms up, push your legs, sit up, real hard. You don't move at first but you just keep pushing in your mind. With me, my body slowly starts to move until it dies and breaks out of SP. 

I compare it to cramp in my leg. Cramp freezes your leg bent in pain. It's the muscles contracting. But you can actually push real hard to straighten your leg which pushes the cramp out. Forcing myself out of SP feels similar to this.

Sleepparalysis,"I (25f) have had sleep paralysis episodes for as long as I can remember. Let’s say around 10 years of age it began.

Although now I am on a deep healing, spiritual journey, I’m still having episodes. At one point in my journey I came across research of how to control SP or to use it as a method of entering lucid dreaming/astral realms. That was interesting, but I think it just caused me more harm than good. I learned some tricks to recognizing/controlling SP episodes, but I think it also caused me to be more susceptible. 

For the last 6 months or so I’ve been processing a lot of old trauma in therapy and rewriting my stories to take my power back.

Sleepparalysis,"For context, I am Hmong and I have a lot of family members who are Shaman.

My first experience started when my mom got sick. Nothing really happened, I would hear things but nothing too scary or freaky. The only thing that freaked me out was the fact I couldn't move. It usually occurred mostly when I was in the living room with her. She slept there because her room was too cold so there were times where I would nap there in case she needed something. I'm sharing this because I wonder if it has any connections to my culture. 

Now my scariest experience happened in my younger brother's room. I was home from school and although I had a room I shared it with my younger sister, so I slept on the airbed set up for my older brother in my younger brother's room . I woke up and for the first time my eyes were open. I couldn't move my body but I was able to move my head and eyes. I knew instantly what was happening. I was confused because usually I'm not able to move anything including opening my eyes. Something was definitely off and I could feel it. I looked to the right of me and was this dark space, almost like a black hole. Within that space was this woman. She was on the ground with hair covering her like those Japanese female ghosts. I could see her arms moving very slightly. She didn't get up or anything but moved steadily towards me. That's when I realized she was crawling towards me. 

In that moment, I wasn't able to move my head back or even close my eyes. I watched her inch her way closer and closer to me. I remembered something my uncle told me, ""Whenever this happens, try to move a small part of your body,"". I tried wiggling my fingers hoping that it would help. 

I could feel my finger moving but it was moving as if it was heavy, chained down to something. All this time, I haven't looked away from this woman. She was right there and stretched out her arm. I was able to break out of it just as her hand reached my face. I threw myself out of the airbed and turned the lights on. My brother's room looked fine, nothing changed other than the blankets that I threw. My heart was pounding and I was breathing so hard. Needless to say, I didn't sleep in there for a while. 

I told my relatives who then told my grandma. She gave me a bracelet that was supposed to help with it. They did stop for a while but they returned after a couple of months. 

This happened my second year in college. I am now in my fourth year. I had other experiences it was just me not being able to move. I didn't see or hear anything during those. I haven't had any since my mom passed away so I wonder if they were connected to my mom being sick. If you're not Hmong or Shaman that may not make a whole lot of sense. It's just a thought that I made so and feel free to ignore this part of the story.",t2_vqqgdzou,0,My scariest sleep paralysis experience,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,10rwxgh,True,Swan05,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10rwxgh/my_scariest_sleep_paralysis_experience/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10rwxgh/my_scariest_sleep_paralysis_experience/,54163.0,1675362552,0,,False,1675362570,1675362571,2023-02-02 18:29:12,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"I sensed myself drifting to sleep but was aware I was awake. I knew I was in sleep paralysis so
I did the finger wiggle test, but it didn't translate into reality. I believe I simply imagined that I was wiggling my fingers, because when the wiggle progressed to my whole hand and up my arm... It seemed less and less real.


I tried using my voice, it felt weak or imagined again. 


I dared to open my eyes, it felt less imagined but to my surprise, and in a state of fear, I didn't see the fambled sleep paralysis demon! 


I closed my eyes, or at least stopped fighting to wake up and something happened. 


My wonderlust was rewarded with serendipity; I began to hear beautiful music! 


It was so clear and loud without discomfort, I almost started crying. 
It had to be an audible hallucination, but I did not mind.


I let each sound bite and song come and go. Some were rock and roll, some were pop, and some sounded like a familiar lullaby. 


One thing they all had in common, was that they were only melodies.

Sleepparalysis,"TW: children. I don’t know what else to say about the trigger, mine just involve children. 

Why?? What is it about the deepest parts of the psyche and their connection to sleep paralysis that make my episodes literally the thing to hurt/scare me the most? 

My introduction to this whole thing? Was torture. If anyone has seen any of the Hostel movies, that’s it. Horrific torture scenes played out around me. 

And then, I started seeing children in them. It’s always a small child around 6-7yo, and they are always being hurt by, that thing. Whether it’s a demon or a creature or a man, it hurts these precious little children. And you know what? It does this to them just a couple inches away from me. Now, I used to teach preschool, I have a child, I nannied the same two littles for four years. Needless to say, I LOVE kids and value them above anyone else. And at least two to three times a week I watch/hear/smell one burning alive, another one being tortured, and now there’s my most recent one.

This one is new. They’ve always been some child I didn’t know that I desperately needed to save, but I’m too gd paralyzed to do anything about this poor child laying right next to me on fire or whatever. Ugh. But…

It’s never been my own son before. Or my mother. This one had them both. They were sitting at their table eating, and she started choking on something. Since it’s just the two of them, and my son is only 9, there was nothing he could do besides call 911 and then watch her slowly die. My son, my sweet son, was watching this and just wailing. I heard it so loud and so clear and it sounded so damn heartbreaking. It still echoes in my head even days later. That was a sound I never dreamed nor wanted to ever hear my son make, and now it’s bouncing around in my brain like a pong ball. 

Why does this kind of horrible shit have to happen?? I don’t want to live with these images/sounds/guilt in my head. I don’t want to feel my heart almost explode because I couldn’t save whatever kid it was that day, from whatever turmoil they were doomed to endure literally right freaking next to me.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi all. Hoping to get some support/advice regarding a significant increase in sp episodes paired with horrific nightmares.

I had my first episode about 12 years ago. Since then, I usually have about 2-3 episodes per year. Recently, I've been going through 2-3 episodes per month, sometimes more. These used to happen without any nightmares attached, would just wake up and be unable to move. Now, I am having very graphic, violent nightmares which result in sp. In all of these nightmares, I am watching someone's death. I am never the one doing it, but I am in some way involved. I've felt the duration of these episodes is longer, but also think I may feel that way because of the terrifying nature of how I'm waking up and wishing it'd stop.

I do a lot of reading before bed. I generally float around on Reddit, and I definitely gravitate towards true crime, cold cases, etc. I've stopped reading that material altogether and I still seem to be having these issues. I've even started to watch cartoons or something lighthearted before settling into bed, in the hopes that my noggin doesn't resort to murderous nightmares.

Anyone else experience this? Any advice or tips? I've generally been okay with the sp, but paired with dreams of such a dark nature have lead me to not want to sleep at all.

Sleepparalysis,"i never thought i would be posting on reddit,  but i really hope someone can give me some incite about what is happening. 

my last experience which happened a few minutes ago, is why i am here now. 

i am in highschool, and i have never had any sleep issues until a few weeks ago, aside from frequent nightmares. 

my first two experiences were very confusing but i figured out that what was happening was i would be in a normal dream, then i would have a false awakening where i would be in somewhat of a sleep paralysis state. i was always accompanied by an extremely loud static sound that went in waves, almost like the ocean. i was unable to move at first but as the dream went on, i could move and i would try to get up and walk but i would be rolling and flailing around trying to gain enough strength. then eventually i would wake up as normal. 

my last few experiences i think were real sleep paralysis occurrences. i have been able to tell they were coming by the way i was falling asleep, because it would feel like my body was falling asleep before my mind and i would start to hear the static that would keep getting louder and louder. this last time i tried a couple times to get out of it but every time i was falling back asleep it would come back. when it happens, i never feel fully conscious though, which is makes me so confused on whether it’s a dream or reality because most of the time i just let it happen to me instead of remembering that there might be something i can do to get out of it. i remember trying to do things that i couldn’t have done unless i was dreaming, such as trying to get help from someone that’s not in my life, so i was definitely in a dream state at some point. but i’m not sure if i was just interpreting what was really happening into a dream. i think i remember gaining consciousness of reality though. i fell asleep on the phone with someone and i was trying to talk but i couldn’t, and i could just barely move my head. i remembered the trick of trying to wiggle your fingers and toes until you gain full control of your body again and that’s what i did. 

i don’t know who i can talk to about this but it has been really annoying and creepy, and i just want to get good sleep. if anyone has any ideas of what’s happening and maybe how i can help it, let me know. thanks for reading.",t2_vbov3zda,0,i don’t know what is happening,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,10qm8a7,True,toe-smasher69,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10qm8a7/i_dont_know_what_is_happening/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10qm8a7/i_dont_know_what_is_happening/,54166.0,1675231592,0,,False,1675231608,1675231609,2023-02-01 06:06:32,,,,,,,,,

    It was around 2 or 3 in the morning. I couldn't move. Time was frozen. I felt

    like what I would it imagine a computer feels like when it freezes. Afterwards

    was a blur. I was able to speak and tried to get my girlfriend to wake up, but

    was well asleep. I don't remember if I was speaking loudly. My brain felt like

    it froze. I couldn't even form any thoughts or opnion about what I was feeling.

    Then all of a sudden it was over. Thrown back into reality with no sense of

    direction.

&amp;#x200B;

    Not the first time. There was a similar experince months ago, but that was related

    to a traumatic dream I had which lead into the episode. Not this time. No obvious

    trigger. I was informed to take 2 pills before bed of which I only took one.

    I was already tired, and figuired I would fall asleep no problem anyway. I'm going

    to wait until tonight or tomorrow to mention anything. I will take two pills

    tonight and see what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

11-21-2022 6:44am

    Yesterday, 11-20, from about 7pm-10pm I took a nap where I started to hear

    aduitory hallucinations followed by alternate world hallucinations. As I was

    dosing off I could hear a voice that sounded roughly like \[girlfriend\],

    and I could make out a word or two but no distinct idea. There were also times

    that I couldn't recognize the voice or what they were saying. Once I dosed off

    I was sent into other alternate worlds in the form of extremely vivid dreams.

    So vivd to the point that I quickly begin to loss grip on which alternate world,

    including the real world, is the legimate real world. While I'm in these

    dream/alternate worlds I whole heartedly think that's the real world; only to

    panickly wake up and realize I was sleeping, and then doze off again into

    another alternate. It's a back an forth between waking up and entering an

    alternate. The alternates didn't happen back to back. I had to wake up and then

    go into another. When I wake up part of me knows I'm having an episode. While

    I'm concious enough to realize on some level it feels impossible to do anything

    about it. I am not my full functional self when I'm having an episode like this.

    I haven't had an episode like this since I started taking Lamotragin and

    Hydroxaxyne about three months ago. Before that it had been a few weeks since

    the last episode.

&amp;#x200B;

    Once the episode ends and I fully wake up it takes a while to go back to full

    brain power. It feels like I'm in a fog for a while. It's dificult to recall

    my exact feelings during the episode and immediately afterwards. It's like

    I don't actually remember feeling a certain way, but I know that I did feel

    that certain way. Ex: I know I was sad, but I don't remember actually being sad.

    I suspect that my sleep paralysis episodes, and whatever these alternates

    episodes are, are some sort of epilepsy. Lamotrigine is a well known epilepsy

    medication. Once I started the Lamotrigine I did not feel an episode was even possible.

    I can feel the buzzing in my head when it is possible. The buzzing doesn't mean it's

    going to happen just that it can happen. If I'm ever falling asleep and I get even

    one aduitory hallucination I will one hundred percent of the time have an episode.

    Also, I'm awake because I have two test at 9 and I'm writing my study guides.

    This journal will be updated more consistenly to be able to track progression

    over time of certain aspects pertaining to my medication dosage, medication

    itself, or any other relevant information I feel needs to be documented.

    The writing in this journal will not be edited for the sake of autheticity.

    If editing is done for the sake of grammar or clarity it will be made clear

    that portion has been edited, and the original writing will be kept and labeled

    at the bottom of the entry.

Third entry:

    The night of december 14, 2022. Written at 7:30pm 12/15/2022

    Last night was my first encounter with a sleep paralysis nightmare. Most times

    have scary, but only because of the experince of SP. This time, the dream

    I would fall into would be a nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

    I was driving down a dark road with a passanger (unknow ID) in the car. We

    drive up to an obvious car crash that's on fire. As I'm running I think back

    to the firefigther quote about ""everyone thinks they'll be the person to run

    into the fire, but you never know until you feel the heat of a fire"". I felt

    amazing knowing I was willing to run into the fire and know that my EMS training

    allowed me to increase patient survival. Me and my passanger get there at the

    same time and I take a first look at the victims.

&amp;#x200B;

    It's horrying. One body was pulled apart like a squid. Increadible volumes of

    blood. The other boys crawling and alive, but the right half of their jaw all

    the way up to the bottom of their eyeball was ripped off hanging by a the

    tinest amount of skin. I could see into where their mouth would be and was

    able to see all the inner damage down to the epiglodis. He looked like a real,

    terrying, zombie. He died after a moment of slow crawling.

&amp;#x200B;

    Woke up at this point

&amp;#x200B;

    Running away was instinct. At no point did I reconsider returning to the patient.

    Fear. Real, deep, fear... instantly dictates your next unconcious action. My

    body, sould, and mind, chose to run away.

&amp;#x200B;

    The news reports on the crash and the severity of the victims wounds. No one

    knew that I was first on scene. The news clarifies that the victim had a

    chance to live, and that if they had received aid quicker they may have lived.

    Dread dances over me while my body fills with fuel. I wish I could do something

    about them. I souldve helped him.

&amp;#x200B;

    An unknows relative of the zombie man was histerrical at the funeral and

    promised to kill me at sight. Obcourse I'm scared, but I don't believe he knew

    a way to find my location.

&amp;#x200B;

    Woke up at this point

&amp;#x200B;

    Cut to me running away from the man from the funeral and another unamed person.

    I'm able to see this from a third perspective, but I was still in control of myself.

    They catch up to me and start punching my face. But this was real. Not as controled

    and calculated as the movies show. Strength, sorrow, and intense power, and

    no mercy beating, I was being beaten to death. It was horrendous. I don't

    remember what I looked like, but I remember it looked worse than the worst

    thing you could find in a medical textbook. Not only did I get to see the beating,

    since I was still in control of myself I also felt all the pain. I've never been

    pushed in real life, but I can't be worse than that beating.

&amp;#x200B;

    This is where the episodes end and my mind went blank. I woke up to my alarm

    and dread going to work. I lie to my boss I'm runnign late for emergency

    errands, and slept for one more hour. It was enough to make me alert for the

    rest of the day.",t2_a448f8u1,0,Journal Entries,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,nsfw,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,True,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,10q84su,True,CastleCrashe,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10q84su/journal_entries/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10q84su/journal_entries/,54156.0,1675193545,0,,False,1675193562,1675193563,2023-01-31 19:32:25,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"Any time I take a nap, and I go to sleep on my back or sitting (such as a recliner), I will 100% have this happen.

I will begin to hear the world around me. I can see like I'm peeking through my own eyelids just squinting. I struggle to do whatever I can to wake up, but I'm frozen and can't move. Eventually I strain enough and start to move my hands in some sort of fashion, but when I blink, I'm right back where I was.

I'll try to look around the room, and often the image of when I first opened my eyes is stuck overlaid. Today was the first time I had imagined something that was not there.

Finally the phone rang and woke me up. It always has taken something abrupt for me to regain control or I just ride it out for an hour.

Other times I feel like I can do something drastic like edge off the couch to wake me up. I'll have scooted my way over but pulling with just my fingers or something and right as I hit the ground, I'm greeted with the sight that I haven't moved an inch.

Yesterday I was able to snap out because I was trying to talk in the episode, but nothing would happen. I then forced my jaw open to yell, then it was like I just powered back on.

Sleepparalysis,"I had experienced sleep paralysis twice

&amp;#x200B;

The first time was at the end of 2022, I was dreaming about playing csgo with my friends. While scoping a guy, I suddenly saw a figure at the bottom left of the scope. I snapped back to reality, opened my eyes, and couldn't move. I heard the continuous, high-pitched, painful screams and heard my parent's footsteps (but it wasn't them, it was something else) I saw nothing but felt like something is above me, watching me while screaming out of its lungs.

&amp;#x200B;

The second time was quite recently, around the end of January 2023. I was in Japan during a vacation with my family. I was sleeping in my room with my brother, still awake at 3.05 AM. I thought it would be a normal night until I fell asleep. The front door of the room was out of my sight, I woke up, couldn't move my body, and saw a slender hand and a head peeking from the wall blocking the front door. I immediately tried to wake up and call my parents. It was so real that I thought someone broke in. And I stayed up all night until I fainted because of exhaustion. For the love of god, it happened again, but now the shit decided to reveal its real presence. No more peeking, it was staring straight into my soul, only for a few seconds, before completely disappearing.

Sleepparalysis,"Two years ago I had the most terrifying sleep paralysis. My room is in the basement and one night I woke up with a weird and heavy sensation on my chest. I looked down and it was a nasty,old, dead lady who was making her way up onto me. Then she stopped and sat on me. I could tell that she was trying to make eye contact with me, but I dodged because I knew something very bad would happen if I looked into her eyes. I could feel her long dead hair brushing onto my face and she really smelled rotten. It felt SO real- I had to go to therapy after this episode..

But it gets worse. Yesterday I sat on my couch in the living room and the plant besides me started swaying like there was wind even tho all the windows were shut.

Sleepparalysis,"Hey, all. I'm new to the subreddit and wanted to share my experience so it helps with my emotions on the matter. It's left me completely torn and open.

I have sleep paralysis once or twice a month. It's a horrible experience to go through, for certain, but nothing compares to this one. It had me shedding tears when I woke up. Thank God for my wife, otherwise I would've been living through it a little bit longer.

It started with it being night time in our hotel room. My wife and the baby went out for a bit to Target, and were on their way home. Nothing too crazy to start out with. I was just watching a bit of TV on the bed, playing on my phone, when I heard a sudden loud thump near the bathroom. I turned my head and looked, but nothing was there so I assumed it was one of my daughters toys that fell off due to the suction cup failing.

When I turned back to the TV, a random woman wearing a sweater and jeans was staring at me, sitting on the couch. She was probably no more than 4-5 ft away from me. She seemed normal, but had eyes that would pierce through someone's soul. She began to smile at me, and told me one thing that started my panic:

""You're going to die.""

I looked at her with shock. I asked her who she was and what she was doing here. All she did was give me a smile. I got up out of bed and grabbed her sweater, asking who she thinks she is and why would she say those things. Still only ever a smile.

I then heard a voice say, ""Hey."" coming from on the bed. I let go of the woman and turned to look. It was the same woman as before, but her clothes are ragged, ripped, and had oil stains all over it. She told me the exact same thing she told me before and then gave me a big ole' smile.

I screamed, asking what she wanted from me and why she is bothering me, but nothing. I grew a pint of rage, and charged the woman, but she disappeared as I hit the bed. I go to turn on my back and this shadow creature pounced on me, and started to strangle me. I could feel its saliva running down my face as I gasped for air. I was frozen in fear and disbelief. I was really going to die here.

And then I kept feeling something more real than the scenario. It felt soft, yet it hit me. I felt it a couple more times before I quickly raised out of bed, gasping for air. My wife was calling my name and throwing shirts at me, trying to wake me up. I started throwing out tears. Out of all my sleep paralysis moments, this was the absolutel worst. I believe I will definitely be seeing a therapist or something because I don't think I can live through another one like this.",t2_5fty0dpd,0,Most Horrific One so Far,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,10pt41r,True,Knytlingr,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10pt41r/most_horrific_one_so_far/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10pt41r/most_horrific_one_so_far/,54146.0,1675154168,0,,False,1675154183,1675154184,2023-01-31 08:36:08,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,I’ve been having sleep paralysis on and off since a young girl maybe around 14 I am currently 25. I have learned recently that I have triggers for when it occurs. Nowadays when I’m stressed or depressed it happens but also when I use alcohol to cope with my feelings it also occurs. When I was young it was always just the pressure and the fear that someone is in my room holding me down. But lately it’s been a lot different… so different that I cried out to god and prayed over and over and over. One morning I was trying to go to sleep and when I thought I was sleep I actually wasn’t and I fell into SP. This time I had a weird feeling in my ear. Almost like my hearing was expanding (sometimes feels like a superpower) lol my ears felt almost like it was going somewhere other than here. Eventually I became so frustrated that in my head I yelled out “WHAT!?” As if i knew someone or something was trying to reach out. Now this is when things get weird.. someone responded with “I want you to help me” :/ I freaked out and woke myself up. But when I woke up I felt calm as if nothing super freaking weird just happened. But the more I thought about it the more scared I became. So I started to pray and speaking to god really helped that time. I’m up now at 2:48am I laying here because SP happened again and I felt like it was good for me to write all this down just so you all can hear my story. No voice this time but my ears rang so loudly that I kept squinting my eyes because it was so loud. I also felt a vibration over my body. So weird &amp; I see a lot of us have a lot of questions.

Sleepparalysis,"I'll begin saying that I've never experienced sleep paralysis in my 20y life to this point, so I don't if this was a sleep paralysis or not, but a friend, who has it somewhat frequently, told me it could be.

This happened a few days ago and it very much disturbed me into not being able to sleep again for the rest of the night it occurred. I was about ~3 hours already in kinda deep sleep when I woke up to two noises: one like an airplane going right on top of my house, and the second horrifying noise of what sounded like thousands of voices at the same time, kinda like when in a mall, school, or any other public space where there are a lot of people speaking, but x100 more voices while also being so damn loud.

Now details. This made me wake up immediately into a fight or flight mode. I could hear the sound of both the plane and the voices high up in the air above my house as if they were going as one whole thing going the usual way a plane sound goes away in a few seconds (You know how we can kinda of pinpoint where things are just by listening to them because our brain calculates where sounds come from in a 3D environment). The voices, although I compared it to public places, didn't sound like any language or coherent thing at all just a jumbo of soundalike words and lots of random screaming. And also It's worth mentioning that I'm a deeply heavy sleeper and have slept through a literal shootout outside my house without noticing.

Again, I've never had any sleep paralysis and this whole thing was purely through sound, which I didn't even knew was possible, so I'm pretty lost and still bothered by it. All I know about sleep paralysis this doesn't look like one but hey you guys probably know better than me right so here I am.

Sleepparalysis,"I remember when was about 13-14 I experienced my first sleep paralysis. 

Of course as a young teen I did not know what sleep paralysis was until I was in my early twenties. All I remember was me sleeping next to my sister we would share beds. I woke up looking straight ahead of me, which was my blanket. Next thing I couldn't move my head nor my body and could not talk out loud. I could feel my heart pounding of shock and confusion. I tried to yell but all I did was mumble words or whining, trying to call my sister. She was asleep as a baby. It went on for about id say 4minutes. Felt like hours. I then woke up the next day and told my parents and sister, no one knew what to say but ""thats weird"". All I could do was just brush it off and forget about it.

Sleepparalysis,"Not sure if this was sleep paralysis or what but not sure where else to post

I was falling asleep and all of a sudden I felt like things got very quiet and had these flashes of images that were physically uncomfortable for me to feel, my eyes were closed so this actually felt behind my eyes, I wasn’t able to think of anything it just felt like I was “experiencing” these quick image flashes (none slow enough that I could react or remember what they looked like/ maybe it was more of flashes of different colored lights but I really don’t know) this lasted maybe 2 seconds? 

My eyes burst open and for a second I can’t move and then my heart is pounding. I often get sleep paralysis and weird sleep things but this is a first for this?

Sleepparalysis,"I think I experienced a form of sleep paralysis last night. It was more so that I was dreaming about having sleep paralysis in my dream if that makes sense? I was aware that I was asleep and that it was a dream and that it wasn’t real even though it felt real?

I was also almost flying at one point but it was as if I didn’t have control it wasn’t voluntary and I was looking into my dresser across from the the end of my bed which is made of mirrors and staring at myself and my eyes seemed really strange and I was aware that I thought they looked off. I had slept for around 5/6 hours and woken up and went back to sleep about an hour and a half later around 5 which is when this happened. I remember wanting it to be over and feeling worried in the dream incase it wasn’t going to stop, but I had a normal dream afterwards before I woke up?

Sleepparalysis,"I'm a 19-year-old female. In the past, I have had dreams where I falsely awaken, and times where I think I've had sleep paralysis. Today from 4-8 am I felt really weird. I woke up several times in the night because of anxiety. I drank a lot of water(3L in like 5 hrs) throughout the day since I was hungover and had worried about water toxicity so that just added to my stress. Anyways around 5, I try to sleep I get this really weird feeling like I'm really heavy(like the feeling when u smoke n feel like ur sinking). I got really scared n woke up n just tried to calm myself down for a while. I tried a second time same thing but I was shaking a little. The third time I was like what would happen if I didn't try to wake myself up? I felt very heavy, almost like a buzzing, and heard noises (don't remember what, maybe like dinging or something) And when I tried to move it wouldn't work. I was scared so I didn't try to open my eyes, and eventually, I moved like an inch and called out to my roommate. I was shaking harder and could feel the shaking getting worse as I was trying to wake up. My head also now feels weird. Is this SP? Could this have been a possible seizure? Could it have been related to the water(water intoxication)? What would have happened if I didn't try to wake myself up (would I just have a regular dream, a seizure, nothing, would it stop on its own, death, etc.)?I need a logical explanation, not lucid dreaming because I would never want to have one I would be way too anxious.

Sleepparalysis,"So I had a really strong sleep paralysis dream last night. The last one I had was about 5 years. In the dream my dad died and I was trying to scream but nothing would come out and I couldn’t move. I made a note of everything that happened and I made 2 sections. One for what my body felt like while it was happening and what actually happened in the dream. Sorry if some of it doesn’t make sense, I just wanted to jot it down before I forgot anything. 
Physical feelings:
-body feeling numb and heavy, not strong enough to move it, weak, brain weak and not working 
-brain was telling body to move but body wasn’t moving
-not in control of my own body
-feeling numb after waking up 
-trying to scream but nothing comes out 
-feeling overwhelmingly scared
-trying to pull out of the dream but can’t 
-vulnerable and overall weak feeling 
-feeling insignificant 
ACTUAL DREAM: 
I was in a supermarket (like a kroger) and I noticed someone following me. I quickly started walking the other direction and hid behind a palette of watermelons. Soon after I was on an escalator and I noticed the person a few steps behind me (no description of the person). Quickly I decided it was time for me to go home. The dream then skipped to when I was in my bedroom. I looked up at the door and saw a gun elevated in the air, but I wasn’t scared yet because I thought it was just a picture from the shooting range I had gone to the day before. Then, a strong, harsh, dense wind forced the door open and I felt this overwhelming wave of emotions. It was then that I couldn’t move. I tried to move my arm but I couldn’t do it. Frustrated, I tried to force myself out of the dream and into the real world but it didn’t happen right away. I was scared and felt trapped. I opened my mouth to scream but nothing came out. It felt like my head was shaking because I was trying so hard to move but nothing was happening. My body felt heavy and I was too weak, physically and mentally to be able to control it. As soon as I woke up I still felt scared but I was able to move my body. I quickly recorded what I remember. My body feels heavier than it normally does and my arms feel numb.

Sleepparalysis,"i just woke up from another sleep paralysis. didn't know where else to go with it so here I am. it's currently 2:30am, i went to sleep around 1:00am. i woke up into a dream knowing that I am paralysed and I can't speak. my girlfriend is sleeping next to me, so I turn my body around to wake her. I scream air at her, trying to show her that I'm sleeping and unable to speak. I'm trying to repeat help help, or some letters like b and d hoping this will get me out of it. later I wake up back again. sleeping turned around towards the room, the same situation happens 3 times, I wake my gf, try to speak, eventually I even do manage to speak with her and I can genuinely hear it and feel her hugging me so I always think that I'm finally out. but then I always wake up right where I started, as if it kept repeating. in my 5th paralysis she told me to go to the bathroom together, so it might maybe help me, so we go,I meet her family members that we live with and I don't question the fact that everybody's awake at 2 am, I don't question my gf sleeping only in underwear and her socks inside out. until I suddenly wake up again into my paralysis, in the same position in bed, trying to scream once again. suddenly I remember that the last time I experienced paralysis, I got out of it by forcing my eyes open. so that helped. in these paralyses I have no demons or ghosts, it's just me trying to escape the state of being half asleep/awake.

now I think it's important to mention some context of my life. I had experienced my first paralysis 5 years ago with some kind of demon that I was trying to run away from.
it was the only one I had until.
(tw suicide)
month ago, i overdosed on my medication and woke up in hospital two days later. I don't remember one whole day and night. then I was transported to a mental facility. before attempt, I was taking medication for my depression before sleep that made me fall asleep easily. in the mental hospital they didn't want to give me my medication for two days because of the intoxication by overdose. so the first night I try to sleep there, I can't fall asleep so I asked the sisters for a pill. they gave me protazin. I fell asleep after 1-2 hours and experienced a sleep paralysis where something was pulling me down from my bed (rather falling to the side of it) and I had the urge to wake up and escape because I knew I was dreaming/sleeping. I don't know how but I managed to wake up and I went for an acute anxiety pill after which I fell asleep normally. next day the same thing happens, I can't sleep so I ask for a pill, they couldn't give me a different one because only a doctor can switch my meds and there wasn't any at night. so I risked the same pill again, hoping it'd be better this time. but it was worse. it was very similar to what I had today. also before falling asleep I told myself that if I noticed something like that happening, I must remind myself that I am sleeping.! so. I woke up paralysed, knowing I'm sleeping but trying to escape the state, I fell off the bed and I was crawling through my room to the sisters' room. again and again. it felt like crawling in a hot desert for a drop of water which is close but so far away and I can't ever reach it because I keep waking up to the beginning of my journey - in bed again. also I was trying to scream again, but only air came out of my mouth, no voice. the fifth time I woke up in bed again, I tried to force my eyes to open and then keep them open so I wouldn't fall asleep again. that got me out of it.

I managed to achieve the same thing today after experiencing the fifth paralysis. I finally woke my girlfriend for real and told her everything.

now I have these weird feelings. I don't know what happened. I thought that protazin made me wake into a dream paralysed but now it happened again, I take my depression and anxiety meds just like I did before I ended up in hospitals. I'm feeling all weird about this, have I messed my brain up by overdosing antidepressants and antipsychotics? or is it the sleeping pill that started this? or maybe theories that it's more than that and I experience a repeating pattern due to breaking the simulation (that I believe in) or maybe when I ""died"" I was transported to another parallel universe where things are different. those are just theories that go beyond medicine and science, I've noticed many strange things since the overdose, not only this, many things are different now. what does it all mean, what have I done.... have I altered something in my brain with the pills.?
btw according to doctors and tests I am physically fine, my internal organs are perfectly ok even though I didn't throw up or got my stomach pumped out (my family took me to hospital late after it happened so my body managed to process it physically.)

Sleepparalysis,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong place but this is the most relevant community I could think of. A few months ago I was suddenly woken up, after sleeping for a bit in the afternoon, by my sister because she wanted something. So i got up and then realised (this is really hard to explain) but I was in my own head and it felt like I was really really far back in my own head. It doesn't make sense but thats exactly how it felt. And I know this sounds even more crazy but I promise you this happened. When I stood up I didn't do that my brain did. My brain literally walked my body across my room, opened my door and then replied to my sister but just spit out absolute garbage. My brain was saying proper words but the sentences made zero sense and I know they didn't make sense because I was there the whole time fully aware but not in control of my body at all! Somehow my brain was doing everything so all i could do was just think to myself what tf is going on. And I know my brain was doing all of this because I was fully aware and could see and hear and could rationally think and speak to myself in my head but I just couldn't control my body at all and felt so far back in my head. And on top of this when my brain was spitting out complete gibberish it then got mad when my sister said ""What are you even saying?"" . I wasn't mad because like I said I was fully aware the whole time but I could ""feel"" how angry my brain was because it didn't understand why my sister couldn't understand it. It was the strangest feeling ever like I can feel that my brain is mad but I myself am perfectly rational and calm at the same time. I guess it felt like if you got a paper cut you can feel your hand hurting but you yourself might be feeling calm at the same time. My brain then closed the door and bang I was fully back. So obviously i instantly apologised to my sister and said I know everything I just said made no sense. But yeah nothing like that has ever happened in my life before and hasn't happened since. Was just wondering if anyone has had a similair experience or understands what the hell that was about. The only info that might be some help is that I do have extremely detailed and vivid dreams but aside from that ive never had sleep paralysis, ive never had a lucid dream, ive never done drugs and i dont drink and i have no medical conditions. But yeah I know this all sounds crazy but I promise you I was fully aware and not sleeping. It all just baffles me honestly.

Sleepparalysis,"My whole life I’ve had sleep paralysis. Almost once a month or more since I was a kid.
 It used to be an old man who haunted my night terrors, I would hear him breathing, and feel as he raised what I knew an axe above my head. When I got older it changed, someone running a cold finger down my back, breath on my neck. Sometimes it would be a demon crawling underneath the door, smiling. And in my 20s it became half heard whispered voices. Sometimes I could make out enough to hear they were talking about me. 
But in the last few years I’ve struggled with depression, it’s become more severe in the last year, and since then, I haven’t had a single episode. Even my nightmares have almost disappeared. I’ve guessed that it may be apathy, dampening instinct as well as emotion. Maybe my brain can’t even gather the energy for that primal fear you feel when you can’t move anymore. I don’t really know, but I never thought I’d miss my demon.

Sleepparalysis,"I have been experiencing intense sleep paralysis episodes anywhere between 3-7 times a week for the past year. At first, it was more tactual. I would feel bugs on my skin or a needle-like pinch. A few months later my episodes got worse and would include auditory phenomena, along with hallucinations and the previously mentioned “physical” pains. The episodes are usually consistent. I wake up in the room I fell asleep in. Nothing about the environment changes, other than the fact that the room is dimly lit as if someone had left the TV on during the late hours of the night. I usually head to the restroom to wash my face but before I can make it, I look down at myself and can hear my own voice telling me something is wrong or that “this isn’t real”. By this point I decide to return to my sleeping place and try to wake myself up again. This can continue for 3-4 layers of me waking up in-dream and realizing nothing is real. When I finally wake my physical self up in the “real” world, I don’t have enough energy to stay awake. I often pass out from exhaustion. After 15 minutes or so I finally force myself awake and do just as I did in my dream, head to the bathroom to splash some cold water in my face. 

I’ve read dozens of articles and tried everything they recommend, like fixing my sleeping position, getting 6-8 hours of sleep every night, refraining from drinking or eating a big meal before dinner, I’ve even stopped horror and thriller genres completely!


Whenever I wake up from one of these episodes I feel very low energy, often accompanied by a very painful headache. On the occasion that I don’t experience a sleep paralysis episode, I definitely feel much happier and comfortable, but it is always short lived. It’s gotten to the point recently where I feel a bit worried to go to sleep in fear of having another episode.

Sleepparalysis,"In the past 3 years me having a sleep paralysis episode was very rare but recently I have been having episodes almost every day.  


Episode 1: A while ago in my aunt's house right after she died (Almost a year ago), I was laying on the couch facing the cushions and looking out the window, and all of a sudden I hear this very intense noise sounding almost glitchy (that's the only thing I can think of describing it.), and all I see is this very white light pouring into my eyes to the point all I can see is some sort of white void, and I thought I was going to die so I said to my self that I don't want to go yet and then all of a sudden it's normal like it was again except I was facing the living room and not the windows anymore and my heart beating rapidly and me being out of breath   


Episode 2: I had sleep paralysis about 3-4 weeks ago I was laying in my bed and I close my eyes for what it feels like a split second and I can't move anymore and I can hear myself choking on my spit and I can hear this very intense and loud ringing sound and I could feel pressure on my chest, arms, and head and all a sudden I wake up and my heart is beating rapidly and I'm out of breath I get up and go to the bathroom cause I'm sweaty, I go to pee and I look in the mirror and notice scratch marks on my neck, I've asked my mom about stuff like noises and she has had them too.   


Episode 3: About 5 days ago, I believe it was 1 am-3 am, and I was laying on a chair in the living room while all my family members were asleep in their rooms. I fall asleep and have a normal dream and then I fade into my episode and I can see the living room, it's like my eyelids were glass, I could see the tv in front of me which was off, and the curtains to the left of me and they were moving like the wind was blowing them and the window was open and again I can hear a very intense ringing noise but I can also hear the wind blowing very strong. I woke up and everything was normal and very very quiet to the point it kinda creeped me out.  


I've been having episodes every single night but I don't remember a single one except episode 4.  


Episode 4: 2 hours ago, I was laying in my bed and I fall asleep it was probably about 4 am-5, (I was probably sleeping for about 1 hour, and my episode probably lasted 30 minutes because I woke up about 7 am, I'm not sure.) I fade into my episode and I hear this devilish laugh in a very low pitch sounding like ""Muahahaha"" while hearing a mix of glitchy and ringing noise but this time it was even louder, I tried to wake myself up by focusing on one point of my body but I couldn't, I was probably there for like 30 minutes, all I see is complete darkness just noises.

Sleepparalysis,"This is more about the ending of my dream, rather than the dream itself.

My dream was coming to an end. I stood near an apartment building in a city. It was late at night, and the city lights gave off an orange hue. The apartment building had some gated in areas with shrubs and other landscaping. I was about to wake up from my dream when I heard my own voice speaking to me. My voice told me that if I opened the door I was reaching for, I would wake up. Then the voice said, in reference to a different door, “But if you open that door, you can wake up without actually waking up.”

I was uncertain what that meant. The voice added, “Try it! See for yourself.”

I opened the door, and I woke up in my room. I found myself in bed with my eyes wide open, and awake. However, my body was paralyzed. I was unable to move at all. I tried-and-tried to move, but I couldn’t budge a single muscle. I knew this experience all too well. It was sleep paralysis, but this was the first time it has ever happened without feeling a presence there with me. That much was a relief.

That said, the more I tried to move, the more I began to panic. I started to hyperventilate, as I tried to move, but I couldn’t budge a single muscle. Then my voice said to me, “No need to freak out! Just close your eyes, come back in through the door, and open the other door instead.”

I closed my eyes, and I was back in the street, in front of the apartment doors. The voice said, “See! You’re back! Now, go out the other door if you want to completely wake up.” I did as my voice said, and I woke up out of the dream.",t2_tztyxxvg,0,I Had Control Over My Sleep Paralysis?,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,10lqwli,True,TacitTokki,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10lqwli/i_had_control_over_my_sleep_paralysis/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10lqwli/i_had_control_over_my_sleep_paralysis/,54092.0,1674736880,0,,False,1674736891,1674736891,2023-01-26 12:41:20,,,,,,,,,

I tried shouting but got muffled whimpering noises. Nothing broke the paralysis.

I lay there for a bit then began to wonder what the weight sensation was.
After a few attempts I managed to flop my arm off my side, down to where the weight was felt.
I slowly moved my fingers about, nothing. Then I grabbed my own leg, sure enough that was it.
Like when your leg goes to sleep and you can feel it but not feel it at the same time.
That numbing effect mixed with my body relaxing its muscles is what gave of the sensation of someone sitting on the bed.

Sleepparalysis,"I originally posted this in another sub as I didn’t know this one existed. Someone suggested I post it here as well. 

So, my oldest son called me this afternoon to tell me about his sleep paralysis incident last night. He’s only called me once before after an incident and he was a little freaked out. This one was definitely different and I wanted to share and see if anyone else has ever experienced something like this. 

He’s had many sleep paralysis episodes. They have always been the same. Dark shadow figure with red eyes looming over him and he can’t speak or move. He describes it as a dementor waiting to suck out your soul.  Never a fun thing to experience. 

He is in the military and has had to move around a lot. He thought he had a timeline down that it would happen each time he moved to a new place. He did have an episode at his current home already so he didn’t expect to have another. Nor did he expect what happened this time. 

He told me that he was having the same sleep paralysis where the figure is standing over him. But then he said all of a sudden, he was outside of his body watching it happen. He said he was mumbling in his sleep with the figure standing over him. His wife was trying to wake him up because his struggling in his sleep woke her up. All while he’s watching it. He thought to himself, I’m going to mess this thing up because it’s messing with me. So he yelled at it to get it’s attention. It turned and looked right at him. He started forward as to grab it and then just at he was reaching out for it, said he was back in his body and his wife woke him up. 

He thought he was having a second layer dream. His words anyway. I’ve not heard of that term before. But this sounds more like astral projection to me.

Sleepparalysis,"I need to start this out by prefacing that I've experienced sleep paralysis many, many times for over a decade. I know what it is, and I'm very familiar with the journey. I've only ever visually hallucinated during a sleep paralysis episode once; my first time, which prompted me to learn about it initially. I've always been able to choose to have my eyes open or closed, and up until recently, I've been pretty good at recognising the onset of it, mentally steadying myself and focusing on the movement of a finger to break myself out of the cycle (this doesnt guarantee that you don't fall back into it as soon as you fall back to sleep, so I always suggest moving position in bed or even sitting up for a moment to allow your heart rate to slow). I say it worked up until recently because the finger trick has not worked for me for at least a year.  
  
Anyway, fast forward to last night. It had been a very broken night's sleep (as it often is when you have SP) and it began with me hearing deafening sounds very much akin to pressurised air being released in sporadic intervals, which is new. These sounds were entirely hallucinatory in nature. After a period of time, this developed into me feeling all the tell-tale signs of onset SP. Heart rate increasing (despite being mentally calm), the feeling of being closed in, pressure on the chest et cetera. I'm wiggling my pinky, then all my fingers. Nothing. Then, with surprising ease, I reach out for my partner. Still, no escape. Before I know it, I'm putting all of my mental and physical energy into curling myself upright. I can feel the bedsheets moving over me; my hands running through the linen... Nothing. I didn't actually achieve sitting up, but I had displaced the bedsheets enough for me to have to pull them back over me. I need to stress, all of these motions were extremely slow, but I was not imagining them. I was moving, and toward the end of the episode I was no longer mentally calm. I was just lied there, writhing around in slow motion, trapped in my mind. I can't actually recall how the episode ended, which is strange.

Sleepparalysis,"One day, quite recently, I decided to have a midday nap, after my alarm woke me up, I decided I was still tired so I reset the timer and went back to sleep. This continued, and this cycle led to whatever the hell this was.

I woke up, feeling someone in my bed, behind me (I sleep on my side). It was a very uncomfortable feeling, and it got even worse when I ""felt"" the person's arm wrap around my stomach. At this point, I tried to move. But I don't think I could? I tried to speak, telling this ""person"" to basically fuck off, also couldn't do that either. I'm very very scared of sleep paralysis so I absolutely did not try to open my eyes just in case.

My breathing was like, automatic, if that makes sense, like I couldn't choose when I inhaled or exhaled, my body just did it naturally. I literally have no idea how, but I managed to keep my cool and just told myself that it was ""sleep paralysis"" and that it would pass, and uh, it did shortly after that. I'm not sure if this was just some sort of vivid dream, or some sort of weird thing that happened as I was waking up.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve experience sleep paralysis dozens of time through my life but never like this. 

Just started nodding off on the couch and as I was falling asleep I experienced this very real sensation of my heart beating insanely fast (almost like it was vibrating). I couldn’t move or see anything and I just remember thinking “well I must be dying”. 

Hard to estimate how long this went on for but I would guess maybe 15 seconds before I realized I’m probably dreaming but even then I couldn’t wake up right away. Woke up maybe another 5 seconds later and was surprised to find my heart rate was normal but I just felt very “off” for the next few minutes.

Sleepparalysis,"I don’t get sleep paralysis very often, but I’ve noticed an odd pattern with my episodes:

* They almost exclusively happen during the morning, when I’m about to fall back asleep. I've had them during the night, though those episodes are rare.
* Whenever they start, my whole body goes numb, I can't move, and I end up having a really hard time breathing to where my throat feels like it's closing up. That's honestly the scariest part; it almost ends up feeling like I'm in the process of dying sometimes.
* My hallucinations are usually auditory, and usually involve hearing voices or music. The best way to describe it is that they sound AI-generated. 
* Oddly enough, I've never had a ""shadow"" figure hallucination as far as I can remember; instead, I get ""burnt"" images in my eyes, usually depicting odd-looking ""runes"" or even full-on words.
   * For example, just today I had an episode-turned-dream, when I woke up, my eyes had a very small ""burnt"" image of what looked like a stick figure that you'd see on a street sign or a restroom sign.

And during this time I'm terrified to move, I can barley open my eyes, I feel a presents that looms over me, I hear it come up the stairs and open my door, sometimes it evan talks. 

The 1st ever one I experienced was last year, the door opened and a dark creature kinda just stood there, 

The 2nd one I had came about 6 days ago, and it was a simular thing, then the day after I had a nightmare my sister was being attacked by a demon, then it came Into my room. It talked to me and tried to strangle me and suck my life force, during this time i mamaged to open my eyes, i saw a bright figgure pulsing light after pf which i got stuck in a dream where i ceped waking up and leaving my bed to find help, only to find it was a dream.

What made me want to post on hear is that tonight it took the form of my dad, i reached out and touched his face (i diddnt actually reach out it was like a dream arm that reached out) he spoke to me and asked me for a number, i then got stuck in a dream again, where i went to my actual dad and it pulled me into the closet.

Sleepparalysis,"This is my first post here, at this point I've been dealing with sleep paralysis for around 5 years now and while I could probably write a whole essay on my experience with it I'd like to focus the hallucinations, visual and audible, partial to make me feel better if I'm not alone with this.

I have had several hallunactions from shadowy ghost-like creature that sucked by breath early in the morning to cackling witches, giggling children and by far the scariest one for me was when a red faced horned creature (kinda looked like Darth maul tbh) that basically jumpscared me.

I've also found that depending on my sleeping position (such as laying on my side or stomach) or just generaly having my eyes covered, the audible hallucinations tend to be more vivid. Most recently I felt a presence in front of me but my eyes were covered, instead of seeing whatever it was I felt something holding the back of my neck while chines rang accompanied by hushed whispers tickled my ears.

Sleepparalysis,"So I first had sleep paralysis when i was 15 during a serious bout of the flu and i was literally trapped in a recurring sleep paralysis cycle where i thought i was able to move but i wasn't and each time i opened my eyes, the hag woman was in a new spot in the room. Scariest shit ever. Since then i've had it maybe once a month, more recently, i had it about 3-4x/month. Last night's one really sucked. I'm a lucid dreamer and can regularly pull myself out of dreams and I pulled myself out of a dream when it started to freak me out a little and i woke up paralyzed. I heard shuffling on the floor at the foot of my bed and then the shadow came to my ear and told me that i should stop pulling myself out of dreams incase they follow me out (wtf i know). THEN the thing starts tickling me and it bites my finger softly. I tell it to let go of my finger or i'm going to scream and it bites harder, so i pull my finger and scream in real life. When i pulled my finger out of the things mouth, i was able to open my eyes and  saw an Imp. harry potter looking dobby type shit imp, laughing with sharp teeth and shadows across the ceiling from it's eyes. My mother heard me and ran into my bedroom to see if i was okay and it disappeared.  Obviously no bite marks but the pain was lingering on my finger when i was awake for at least 10 minutes. 

NOW, i have had sleep studies done. I have no sleep disorders, i don't snore, i don't have sleep apnea, and i don't sleep on my back, i sleep on my side or my stomach exclusively. 

Has anyone else gone through this?

Sleepparalysis,"Had the most terrifying dream I've ever had after taking some Ashwagandha before sleeping. I've also been taking Lions mane and Moringa leaf daily along with the ashwa. It was one of those dreams that felt real where you could physically feel and sense things. I was laying in my bed and I could feel the household cat walk on my back, looked up at them and then put them down on the floor. Then all of a sudden I felt something else fuzzy the same size as a cat crawl on my back but it felt heavy and dark (As in my whole body could feel it's heavy dark presence) I could feel it emenating a dark energy as it crawled on my back, pure dread that was almost like static going through my body, like the whole atmosphere of the room went from normal to pure dread and nightmarish. 

This is where things really got terrifying and distrubing. I could feel it crawling up my back and then up to my neck where it layed/weighed down on the back of my neck put its mouth to my right ear and started to let out a deep consistant gutteral growl like it had its mouth wide open the whole time, I was too afraid to look up at it and I was frozen/paralyzed with fear. I ended up actually trying to scream for help almost in real life because it was making me literally cringe to the point where I was tensing up my shoulders towards my neck. I wanted it to get off of me but I couldnt because of being frozen in fear and then it ended. Most terrifying dream I have had hands down and it felt so real. It felt like what I imagine a black weasel wrapped on the back of your neck would feel like and the weight felt like a fire blankets heaviness if you have ever held one or covered youself with one.

I am a 28 year old man, no dreams or nothing usually scares me but this did. I've heard of people having sleep paralysis experiences before and I was skeptical until now.

This is a online A.I image I created from a word prompt of what I imagine/pictured was on my neck.

Also, I want to say this as well that this didn't feel right at all like something bad 2 days ago when my grandmother died of cancer and I remember this like it was yesterday it was about maybe 2 weeks after the funeral I was sleeping on my back and again I was in a sleep paralysis but this time it was different I felt as if there was some warm aura above me and I was awake it I was scared but I wasn't then I felt as if someone was coming towards my ear and it was my grandmother's voice and she told me ""By (my name) I love you"" and then after that, I felt her moving away and as soon as it was going I then got up as if she didn't want me to freak out but this was a good feeling today was not.

Sleepparalysis,"Hey, so this feels random but-

I think I fell asleep really late last night, after listening to true crime which I normally do, but now I feel like I can’t do that again.

Anyways, I remember laying on my side, and suddenly hearing a lot of different noises. I can’t recall them well, it just sounded like someone was in my apartment, and I got this awful feeling like someone was with me and I panicked. I couldn’t move, or at least I think I couldn’t, and after laying there for a while in pure terror and with my heart racing, I suddenly felt like someone laid down on top of me pushing me further into my mattress. It can’t have lasted more than maybe 10 seconds, but I was sure I was going to die or something horrible would happen to me.

I think I panicked so much that I woke up, and everything was a bit foggy after that. Took me half an hour staring into my dark room until I managed to get up and turn on a light. Never experienced this before but it was awful and I needed to get it off my chest.

I didn’t see anything, thank god- but I seriously thought someone had broken in and was trying to hurt me, and I’m pretty sure it wasn’t a nightmare.

Sleepparalysis,"A little bit of background...I am in my mid 30s and have bipolar disorder and all that comes with that.  I also have multiple, debilitating and rather stressful medical issues, several of which are autoimmune. 

I have been a sleep ""walker"" since I was just a kid.  Now... this is where it gets a little bit weird. To my knowledge, the sleep walking episodes haven't happened in quite some time, but I am atrophied in both of my legs, so walking in my sleep (or even awake for that matter) is extremely difficult to do without assistance from my cane or another person.  

Before I start in on my sleep paralysis stuff, I feel compelled to let everyone know exactly what I do now while sleep ""walking."" Unlike what most people assume when I mention that I sleep walk on occasion, I dont actually get physically up and walk around anymore. Instead, I tend to just sit straight up and stare at the wall in front of me, with my eyes either mostly open, or sometimes fully open.  My husband has found me like this on many occasions and he says he usually just gently pushes me back down to a lying position and tells me to go back to sleep, and most of the time, I do.  Also no, I never ever remember these episodes. 
. 
Now for my **sleep paralysis** episodes. My husband suffers from it a lot, but he let's the panic of not being able to move terrifying and I typically wake up because he is screaming at the top of his lungs.. essentially while still sleeping.  

However, when I get it? I immediately realize what is happening and I pull, what I call, the ""Kill Bill Recovery"" lol. What I mean by that.. is that I do not panic at all. I instantly know why I can't move and I work towards telling my body to move a muscle.. any muscle.. even the twitch of finger or a toe and once I make that happen, I'm then able to yank myself out of the paralysis and get my body to wake up.  

Here's the thing though .. I have read countless stories that others have given about their own experiences with sleep paralysis. However, I have never once felt panicked or experienced any sort of hallucinations the way that many (and from what I've read and seen - *most* is probably more accurate) people have experienced during their own sleep paralysis episodes. 

My mum has said that she is the exact same way as me and does the exact same thing to try to wake her body up as well.  So, I guess my question is somewhere along the lines of.. is it normal to remain so ""logical"" despite experiencing what should be a relatively or completely terrifying event? l

Sleepparalysis,"I've personally never had experiences with nightmares, demons, witches, or any other supernatural being when experiencing sleep paralysis.  


Instead, I feel as though I am awake, yet unable to breathe or move. I attempt to scream, but I cannot do so. I cannot tell if it is a dream or if I am awake.  


However, I am 33 years old and have been having these experiences since I was a child. I've had at least 100 of these experiences in my life. It almost always occurs when I am sleeping on my back, and especially if my neck is bent backward because I am sleeping too high on a pillow or if my neck is hanging off of a bed.  


When I become aware that I am experiencing sleep paralysis, I no longer become anxious, as it has happened so many times to me.  


If am semi-aware of what is happening, I will call for help in my dream state, but it is more of a recognition that something is wrong. I then attempt to cough to get my lungs working in my dream state. That normally works.  


If I am more awake than asleep, I will wiggle my toes or fingers to get my body to snap back into my control. Normally this works very quickly for me.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi,

It's been probably around a year where I've purely experienced the paralysis effect waking up. Then I started seeing shadowy spider creatures hanging on top of me. And my first reflex would be hiding under my sheets as soon as my body would finally start to move. Yesterday I saw a slenderman type of figure with a beak and ghostly tentacles turning around to me, and the only thing I had going for me was moving my arms and hiding under my blanket . Today was straight up from a phasmaphobia (horror game) death animation, I woke up on my side and started seeing 3 shadowy strings and immediately hid under my blanket as my typical defense mechanism, the strings left but my heart started beating harder. As the strings reappeared, I tried to let out a small growl but felt like i had no control of my vocals. The last thing I heard was a distorted chuckle.(as if it was mocking me for trying to react) This seems to only happen while waking up on my own and not to my alarm, and it releaves me to know I'm not the only one to have these episodes as disturbing as they are.

Sleepparalysis,"At about 1am, I was laying in bed reading an article on my phone, when I had a strange and frightening experience that possibly only lasted.. maybe 20 seconds? I'm not sure. I suddenly felt one of my hands start to gently clench and my head felt like it was being pulled back. My heart very quickly started thumping very hard, so much so that it was almost a full body sensation. It felt like a wave rushing over me or like I was being pulled from my own body. I tried saying my partners name but couldn't - it felt as though I was just sucking in air. I absolutely thought I was dying but just as quickly as it began, all of these sensations entirely stopped. I was left very confused and felt like I couldn't get my body to try to move or say my partners name; though I do feel like I had the physical ability to move and speak. Gradually this confusion wore off and it was only then that I could really analyse what happened and what I'd felt. It was a very intense experience.

History: 
Felt unwell for about an hour before this happend. A bit nauseous, dizzy, headachey and had tingling lips. Nothing terrible though.

Suffer with severe headaches that often wake me up in the early hours of the morning. Was hospitalised for the first one I experience about 1.5 years ago and tested for SAH. Results came back clear but Dr informed me that this didn't completely rule out a small bleed out as many hours had passed between headache onset and testing. I probably get about 2 of these a months since then. Also developed occasional visual aura (usually without headache) and on one occasion, experienced my whole right arm go completely numb without me having laid on it awkwardly or anything, lasted a fair while.

Have required several blood tests since October last year which generally indicate inflammation and VitD deficiency. I've been taking 2000 units of VitD for a few months now.

Edit: something my other half has just reminded me to add. As well as occasionally experiencing a visual aura since my first headache, I also think I may have a few hallucinations. I quite often hear my partner speak to me or my phone ring - so much so that I've tried to answer it. On one occasion, I also noticed the carpet warping in front of me.

I’ve been experiencing sleep paralysis for almost 2 years. When it starts i immidiately figure out what’s happening and try to endure the claustrophobic feeling. Tell myself its going to be over soon but each night they get longer and longer. A classical paralysis for me goes like I wake up and realize im having a sleep paralysis, i try to stay calm and move slightly. after a while with very little range of motion i start moving. its like moving under water. And then the violent part starts. I either want to see me hurting myself or people hurting me. It gets really brutal here and i wake up after a while.

Sleepparalysis,"Let's make this a long story short. I've had SP for about 15 years now, off and on.. and it seems to be getting more intense with age. 

Started out as waking up paralyzed and hard to breathe, like sleep apnea or something. Then it turned into being grabbed and dragged by.. spirits? 

First vivid one was about 8yrs ago, being grabbe by one leg one way and one arm the other way, and heard kids laughing like they were fucking with me.

The last three vivid ones within the last year were:

1. I was grabbed and floated up really high then dropped to the ground, but it caught me before I hit the ground and repeated multiple times.

2. I was sleeping at a cottage with my girlfriend, and I was dragged out of bed by my legs and it was swinging me around the room in a circle while my girlfriend was K.O.'d in the bed.

3. This week, I had about three sets of hands repeatedly grabbing my sides really hard, almost like when you're getting tickled, but very hard.. then during that I was trying to tell my girlfriend to wake me up, and she plugged my nose so I couldn't breathe (in the dream of course) this one lasted about 15 minutes.

I used to be able to wake myself up fairly quickly during these, but it hasn't been working lately and they're getting significantly longer.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I can actually feel pain during these ""episodes"". The last one legit hurt my sides and was extremely vivid. It sucks, and I know I'll survive lol.. it just kind of ruins my sleep and leaves me exhausted the next day.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi there, I'm not really sure what my goal is with writing this post but in general I'm kinda scared to go back to sleep.
I don't get sleep paralysis often but it's not exactly a rare occurrence either and it's usually terrifying, the first time it happened I couldn't sleep with the light off for two days because there was this creepy looking creature staring at me through the window during the paralysis. 
Anyway the main reason I'm making this post is because it just happened twice it a row, first it was short but there was this floating faceless doll staring at me and I was utterly terrified for a bit but it didn't last long when my brain finally connected that it was the sleeve of my shirt that was hung up next to my bed.
Afterwords I tried to go back to sleep and I ended up having it again, and this time it felt like it lasted an hour or more and I started to genuinely fear I was paralyzed.

I'm very tired because this happened really early but now I'm scared to go back asleep incase it happens a third time and it's even worse.

Sleepparalysis,"I only began experiencing SP a year or less ago. Prior to experiencing it, I saw a couple SP memes referring to SP demons and whatnot ans thought it was bizarre. When I actually experienced SP - it was very clear based on the name sleep paralysis that it was exactly what I was experiencing. I didn't understand the demon thing though and thought it was more metaphorical. As in, SP itself is the demon because it's an unpleasant and scary experience. But then I learned, and see often in this subreddit, that people do actually refer to demons and scary, nightmarish things happening during SP. 

I have had more dream-like SP experiences. Where it initially seemed like SP, but something weird and dream-like would happen. I wasn't sure if it was actually SP, or a regular dream of me experiencing SP. For example, I'd think I was having SP and then I would feel like I was falling and I'd think I had fallen off the bed and was stuck on the floor. I would try to yell for help (my fiance is usually asleep on the couch) and I couldn't yell. Somehow I'd end up back on the bed. My 3 year old son sleeps in my bed, and one night while I thought I was experiencing SP, I was afraid I was stuck ontop of him and crushing him and unable to move myself, and again, being unable to yell for help. I have had at least 1 or 2 SP experiences where I was worried of a dark presence or something scary, not neccessarily a demon, but something out of a nightmare. (It was awhile ago and I don't remember the details, only remember the fear). Anyways, I have experienced SP where it's very obvious it's simply SP and other times where I am in a dream/dream like state where I am experiencing SP and I was questioning whether the latter was really SP or not.

I guess I still am not sure if I was truly experiencing SP when those things happened or if it was a regular dream of me having SP, but I really appreciate the ""What is SP?""  sticky in this subreddit because it more than my original perception. I see primarily demon or dream-like SP posts and it had cast some doubt. I am glad I finally noticed this post and took the time to read it. Hopefully I am not alone here.

Sleepparalysis,"It happened while trying to fall asleep. My body was tired but my mind was still racing because my ex and I had finally decided to go no contact while I still love her. 

The first few times were normal enough: the whole lying there awake but not being able to move, or talk. Simple enough.

But the 5th time was the worst one of all and what kept me up the rest of the night.

I tried to shout but it shushed me and licked more. it pulled at my arm again. I couldn’t see it. The eye on my left side was closed. I forced my right eye open and I saw a man wrapped in white.

Sleepparalysis,"Couldn’t move or scream but this was different. I was definitely awake but still in a dream I think? The most casual dream ever… Cody (my husband) was cuddling me but then his eyes shot open and he pulled my head in closer and said “It’s my mom.” 

I tried to ask him what he was talking about because we don’t live anywhere near his mom but found that I couldn’t speak. I felt my heart start to race because I think I knew what was happening (I don’t often experience SP but the last time I had it was 12/22/22 and I experienced it twice that night- didn’t see anything weird though). 

He said “I think she’s sleep walking” and then I looked out the corner of my eye because I couldn’t turn my head to look at her. And sure enough, a woman with crazy dark hair, who I would have assumed to be his mom too, was inching closer to us from the bathroom (the bathroom door is about 5 steps from my side of the bed).
 
I looked back over in Cody’s direction and he kept hugging me tighter. He said “I really hope she doesn’t jump at us.” I looked back out the corner of my eye to see why he would say that and she was RIGHT in my face. It was more like in the opening of mine and his face. Her hair was dangling and it was touching me but I couldn’t feel it. Her hands were up In a ‘I’m gonna tickle you motion’ and she had a huge grin on her face but it was really hard to see. She was pushing her face into ours but I couldn’t feel it. It was such a weird thing to experience. 

When I snapped out of it, Cody wasn’t actually cuddling me but he was laying really close to me and facing me. I was in the same position. It was strange because it was like I had snapped out of SP but was hallucinating all the other things. Like my body was in the exact position, the door to the bathroom was cracked the same amount, the amount of darkness in the room was the same. The only difference was that my husband wasn’t holding me and there wasn’t a woman. 

I’ve experienced SP a handful of times before but NEVER with a “sleep paralysis demon.” I’ve googled it and apparently the demons you see look like little goblins that sit on your chest so I’m not exactly sure what that was that I saw.

I couldn't open my eyes or move for about a minute while the ice and liquid sound continued. Finally, I was able to move my arm and the sound went away. I was lying still afraid to move until my one dog out of three did a low growl/bark as if needing to go outside and pee. My wife woke up and I had her turn on the light to be less freaked out. I've had intense nightmares and didnt freak out a fraction as I did 2 night ago. Still not sure if this was my imagination or real sleep paralysis.

Sleepparalysis,"Hey. Please read the entire text, I’ll be thankful for help. I have a terrible biological clock, and usually fall asleep at very late hours, and sleep about 2/3 hours a day.  A year ago, in February, I’ve had my first sleep paralysis. I remember it had a dark, butcher-like character coming at my way. I didn’t mind it for very long, because I thought it was a one-time thing. Then, 2 months later I had it again. This time it had a scary figure on my ceiling which turned out to be a source of light coming from my window. Just as the other time, I didn’t care about it, I’ve read a little about sleep paralysis and figured that it’s nothing to worry about. 2 months later I was paralysed once again. And the next 2 months later the same. When I realised that it occurs regularly every 2 months I started to worry. I started taking notes of everything I saw during all of the paralyses. I figured that with each every paralysis the hallucinations and the dreams before them are getting darker and scarier. An hour ago I’ve experienced another sleep paralysis, and this time it was a rollercoaster. It was very long, I was regularly switching between being awake and asleep. The stuff I saw or heard was insanely terryfing I can describe it with insane detail, which I did in my notes but it’s in polish. Should I go make a visit to some doctor or psychiatrist?

Sleepparalysis,"Randomly during my dream I woke up and it was black. I was aware my mind was awake but I couldn’t move, otherwise my heartbeat would race, and I could feel it really loud in my ears. Every time I moved it happened, so I had to slowly move, and stay calm - I kept saying to myself that I was a wave of calm in a sea of chaos or something (I never say that to myself but sure)? Then I managed to “fight my way back” to waking up. It was 0:50 when i woke up.
, and I went to sleep about midnight. Now I’m not feeling great about sleep. 

Side notes: I’ve had similar occurrences before where I have to “fight my way back” and everything’s really loud in my ears. But this is the first time I’ve had it twice in one month — last time I had it was very similar, about 2 weeks ago. Only lifestyle difference: 2wks ago started doxycycline course to get rid of sinus infection, stopped because of side effects e.g. anxiety. Had what I had now on my first night of it. Now on amoxicillin to get rid of it, my first night too. But is that just a total reach, considering I’ve had amoxicillin before and been totally okay? What the hell is going on?

Sleepparalysis,"My first and only experience with sleep paralysis was about a year ago when I was lying next to my friend and I opened my eyes to my hoodie strings floating in the air by themselves. I looked over to my friend next to me and his eyes were wide open and his mouth was open and it just looked so off. 

I looked away, and looked back and his mouth was even wider and his eyes were even more open. I looked away and then back over again and his mouth was wayyyy to wide open for it to be real and his eyes were bulging out his head and he looked angry. I tried to get up and scream but ofc that didn't happen bc I was paralyzed. Eventually as I faded awake, we both started floating and I woke up lmao. Before I woke up I was terrified because this has never happened to me to naturally I thought there was an actual demon possessing him. I'm still shocked that it wasn't real because it felt SO real.

Sleepparalysis,"ok so i had an experience last night that i cant shake and i cant stop thinking of it. so i went to sleep just fine and at one point i was in a dream and its like i woke up in the middle of it, but was still in the dream. I was in this house that i dont think ive ever been in and everything looked like a weird realistic animation. (reminded me of dont hug me im scared) and i was outside on this patio and i was talking to this girl that I just met a few days ago irl and all of a sudden everything stops, my body feels heavy and the only movement i can make it turning my head. She tells me to stop and not look and i look to my left and there’s 2 guys standing there that i also know irl and i turn back to her and she just freezes. I look left and their heads snapped to the left and it was extremely unsettling and i felt so much anxiety and i kept looking back and forth between the girl and the dudes, and everytime i looked at the guys they would get closer and more distorted and menacing. Then right before they got close to me, i hear myself telling me to just wake up, just wake up, then i don’t remember this next part too well but i’ll try to explain it. I wake up in my bedroom i check the time and its 3:03, and i still didnt feel right and still felt extremely heavy. I went back to sleep but when i closed my eyes i still saw my room and idk how to explain this at all but my perspective was from directly above my body, like i was looking through a camera right above my head. Then i hear myself behind me and i turn and it’s literally me on the corner of my bed and i said something but i can’t remember what it was. Then after that i don’t remember anything. This is the second time anything like this has happened to me and both occurrences have been terrifying and recent.

Sleepparalysis,"i’ve started getting SP literally every day if i don’t fall asleep listening to music. i don’t know how or why it’s gotten so bad to the point where it’s inevitable that i get it if there’s no music playing. 

my sleep schedule has been roughly okay and consistent, i don’t sleep on my back, i don’t sleep at a point of extreme tiredness. usually these would be the causes of it. so idk why i’m getting it? is there ever a concrete reason? :/ 

usually when i’d get SP, it would be scary af to the point where i’d wake up traumatized and cry. now it’s just normal? the usual now is loud screams of names and the feeling of falling through the air. at this point is this even SP? cuz it’s not ‘scary’ or even a figure approaching me anymore, i’m just trapped in my own body in a state of half sleep, not visualizing anything made up.

i only get it when i’m falling asleep, never gotten it while waking up, and i feel it coming on and can usually get out of it by wiggling my fingers/ toes. but now, more recently, when i try resisting the episode and try getting out it, whatever i’m experiencing intensifies? the screams get louder, and etc. 

in the past week i’ve gotten it at least twice per night and have to resort to listening to music while falling asleep. they’re really short episodes compared to usual and it’s concerning me that it’s frequenting so much.

i just wanted to rant i guess but if anyone has any tips? on how to make this happen less often (if that’s even possible)

Sleepparalysis,"So I’ve had sleep paralysis my entire life, I’ve experimented with it and been scared outta of my mind and here’s what I can say. 

1. While you are “awake” you are still in an highly lucid state. So anything u think about will happen in that state of thought your having.

2. This could just be me, but when I’m extremely tired and lay on my back I get almost guaranteed sleep paralysis. It seems for me having healthy sleep habits reduce the chance of it happening.

3. It also seems somewhat genetic as well. But of course it’s hard to confirm that are not. Would be nice if u mention if your family members have it like you.


4. This is mostly a slight tip but if your having bad sleep paralysis try to think of something you like, or if your religious start praying in all seriousness.


All in all good luck and I hope you can over come this or even dive deeper and try to do something you normally can’t do in a dream.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve had about 6 episodes in the past 10 years.

Mostly frightening because the only thing I can control is my breathing, which is the mechanism I use to wake my wife up so she can snap me out of it (fast and intense breathing and that will wake her up).

My last two times I felt something extremely weird. The second to the last time I felt like if out of this world entities were watching me, but not in the room, remotely. I’ve never felt anything in the room with me or an evil presence.

The last time I ever had SP was mind blowing. It felt like I was dreaming but everything was pitch black. Then I saw a point of view from what seemed like thousands of light years away and it traveled or zoomed in to earth all the way up to my head in a matter of a split second.

Sleepparalysis,"Its currently 2:42 am, my episode started at approximately 2:38 ended 2:40. 

At first I thought i was still asleep, my body relaxed, nice slow heavy breathing, that warm fuzzy feeling you get in the morning too lazy to get up. I wasn’t afraid of anything, i felt nothing but peace. Seconds later it all quickly made a sharp turn. It’s like i was able to think as if i flipped a switch in my brain and i could just think. For some reason at the moment all i could do was think, then sound stared to slowly fade in, ringing, the fan to my left blaring, even the faint meow from my cats. Maybe i was waking i thought, so i tried to open my eyes. The fear i had felt the second i opened my eyes and had seen what was the most terrifying episode of my life, had made me jump into shock, and i then started to panic. Some women, person, or thing long white hair, barley gasping a glimpse of face to my left holding me down. I could feel it’s pressure as it held me by my leg and my chest. I could try to yell and scream i thought but only slight mumbles of sound reach out. Something in me was so scared i eventually kicked my leg out of it and woke up, nothing was there. I was barley breathing and i’m happy to be alive. 

I was so scared i am having the goose bumps literally just writing this. I hope you guys enjoyed my story, i hope this can relate to anyone.

Sleepparalysis,"I was wondering if anybody else had the same experience. 

I started to have SP episodes since I turned 12. The first episodes were just the classic silhouette near my bed and hands coming out from the wall to grab me. What I found particular about these negative experiences was that all those things I saw were surrounded by a blueish-white aura. 

After some time, I experienced other SP episodes. 

In one of them, I saw my bird (recently deceased) flying around in my room. What's strange is that I got up from bed instantly, thinking how it got out of the cage and trying to catch it. I was incredibly confused that I couldn't see it anymore so I turned on the lights, and that's when I realised it wasn't real. 

In the second episode, I opened my eyes while sleeping and I saw what I thought was my mother (looked and talked like her) in the doorway. I looked at her confused, she told me to follow her and ran to the end of the hallway, where my parents room was. I got up from bed and followed her, while being extremely confused why the hallway was so dark (when I saw her, it was lit up in a warm, yellow light). I opened the door to the room where my mother was sleeping, and saw her laying in bed. 
*Confusion 2.0*
I called her name and she woke up telling me she's glad I woke her up, because she was having a nightmare. 

I have to say that when I saw my bird and my ""mother"" while in SP I didn't feel any fear and the light was different from the usual, scary SP episodes (warm yellow compared to blueish white).

Sleepparalysis,"Hello,

I have been suffering from an extremely prolonged bout of insomnia which is connected to sleep paralysis. I have posted about the problem before and how I will continually fall into sleep paralysis when I attempt to sleep, which forces me to struggle and wake up in an endless cycle.

I do not have any positive health updates since my last post but I thought I should give an update as a sort of warning.

Since the problems have escalated, I have been having increased problems with severe stress, causing muscle and stomach problems and difficulty emoting and thinking in a linear way. Problem solving has become difficult and I have become very paranoid.

I go in and out if a sort of psychosis.

Unfortunately, not a single person I know understands or can empathize with any of these issues and people seem to get angry when you bring them up, in my experience.

This has also led to suicidality but moreso in the way of uncontrolled thoughts that I am not trying to bring about, likely as a result of the physical and mental stress

I am confident I will be ok (and if not, so be it God’s will), as I am an adult and will not give up.

I am not sure how this all connects, which issue is fueling the other (i think it is all tied to having family problems and sleeplessness).

But I wanted to post regardless to issue a warning: while sleep paralaysis may not be a big issue for most people, it can actually be quite serious, at least it has been in my case.

Sleepparalysis,"So glad I found this sub!  It's nice to know I'm not alone!  I had a sleep paralysis episode several years ago that really stood out from the other ones I've had.  I hallucinated something coming into my room, looking vaguely human, but trotting on all fours over to the side of my bed (we didn't have a dog at that point in time).

It came up to the side of my bed and started whispering things.  Don't remember what they were but they both terrified and saddened me.  Like it was tearing me down emotionally.

By the time I could move and speak, I still felt like there was something in the room with me, so I commanded it to leave in Jesus name (I'm a Christian, so that was my first thought).  The feeling left right after I did that and I felt calm enough to go back to sleep.

For a day or two after that, though, I had this feeling of impending doom that I just couldn't shake.

Sleepparalysis,I usually have very short bouts but this time was wildly different and I’m not sure why. Went to sleep listening to classical music like normal. I’ve kinda trained myself to keep my eyes closed when I get SP so I don’t see anything and it passes very quickly. This time though when I awoke I was unable to bring myself out. Instead I had the sensation of my whole body shaking violently yet not moving at all. I also had an incredibly loud ringing in my ears. I was able to hear my music fine the whole time but drifted in and out of paralysis and almost sleep for 40 minutes. I kept giving up on moving so instead would try to make myself either sleep or dream. But every time I visualized something it would trigger me back to fully awake and still paralyzed.

Sleepparalysis,"I occasionally have some weird sensations at night. 
My chest will feel heavy, like a pressure (or like my 70 lb dog sitting on my chest). 
My head/ brain feels tingly, fuzzy, or zappy. 
And then it feels as if part of me is being lifted/sucked upwards slowly. It's hard to explain -but the best way I can describe it (for anyone familiar with Harry Potter) is it feels as if a dementor is slowly sucking away my life force/soul.


I will snap myself out of it because it's uncomfortable and anxiety producing, and I think  just the simple fact of being aware and conscious of this feeling prevents me from falling asleep anyway. It will happen multiple times in a night, so I will try to keep myself up for a while to avoid it.

Last night as it was happening for the 3rd or 4th time that night, I got paranoid that something serious was going on. Like a stroke or seizure and that I was legit dying. I don't know why I went to the worst-case scenario. But I stayed awake for a while, and I it did not happen again, but I did have my regular old sleep paralysis happen later. 

I first experienced sleep paralysis about 1.5-2 years ago. 
My has been better for the past several months, so I haven't been experiencing sleep paralysis as often as I was when it first started. 
I don't remember when I first noticed this other weird thing happening to me, but this is the first time I remember experiencing both in one night. 

Anyways, it got me thinking - is this feeling I described while falling asleep/before falling asleep also considered sleep paralysis? Or related to sleep paralysis in any way? Have/do others experience this as well? 

This feeling is much shorter than my sleep paralysis experiences, and I can't confidentally say whether or not I can move at all when I notice this feeling. Which is weird, I feel like I should remember that from last night, but all I remember is the feeling, particularly the chest feeling and being sucked away, as well as the panic / train of thought. Whereas during what I know for sure to be sleep paralysis, the not moving  part definitely is something I remember and can confidently say happens.

Sleepparalysis,"Yes, a few weeks ago I had my first experience with SP, today just a few minutes ago, the second one happened. First I would like to clarify that I have an irregular sleep schedule and spend too much time in front of my PC, either because of work or to game, although I do exercise myself I think I do more damage by staying up late. 

Now, for my dreams, the first one I remember a kid calling me, I felt something grabbing my arm but then everything turned dark and I could hear him right next to me, he was only saying 'hey' but I was scared and wanted to wake up, suddenly the voice started to get mad, and kept saying 'hey' at this point I'm desperately trying to leave this dream but can't do it until a few seconds later, those felt like hours, everything was ok in my room, I was lying on my right arm which caused me to feel like something was grabbing that arm, but the terror stayed there with me.

The second one happened just a few minutes ago, and was the reason why I joined this community and wanted to share my experience. I was climbing a tower, I call it a tower, but to be honest it might as well have been a pit of concrete with a few steps and a big black hole in the middle, I was looking at my cellphone but the screen seemed to be weird, I can't describe how weird, but it didn't seem normal, then I got a call from my uncle, when I swiped to get call it said my brothers name and a legend that said he had passed away (he is fine and healthy btw), I suddenly rushed the stairs and found my dad's family, and there was my uncle, he told me why I had been calling him and saying nothing, I answered that I didn't know anything about making calls, but then I saw my cousin and wanted to ask her about my uncle, when I mentioned the calls her eyes turned pitch black. At that moment, I started to want to get out of that dream, I was pretty scared, and started to call out to my mom, I swear I was yelling at her, to my left I could hear a man's voice repeating the same things I was saying, to my right I could hear my mom calling my name and trying me to wake up. I opened my eyes but I could see neither of them.

Today was different.

I had woken up early and been awake for over an hour. Tried to go back to sleep. When I finally knew I was getting close I leaned into the experience. My eyes were still open. Then I felt sleep paralysis with my eyes open. 

It was very alarming at first but I used my normal strategies to _break out_ and I did. My eyes were open the whole time and when I snapped out everything I saw like morphed into the real room in an instant.

It appeared that he was nearly touching the ceiling with his head. The only feature I could make out was his hat. After what felt like eternity I gained control of my body and quickly turned on my phones flashlight and saw nothing. I turned on all of the lights and still nothing.

Sleepparalysis,"I have been wanting to share my experience with sleep paralysis for a long time now. I had it quite severely as a teenager, but today it is seldom. The accounts of my story to be shared with this audience will be communicated as accurately as I myself have experienced them. 

My first ever account of sleep paralysis was at age 11. I had no clue what sleep paralysis even was until 16. I am 27 currently. I thought I was being haunted, but it feels better to know that this is a condition that other people have, and that there is information about it out there.

Anyways, I remember this first occurrence probably the most clearly of them all. It was early in the morning, 5:38am to be exact. I had a digital alarm clock facing my bed.

I wake to see the time immediately. I usually wake up at 6am at this age to watch backyard habitat on animal planet before getting ready for school (s/o to backyard habitat bring it back please). In my line of sight behind my alarm clock, you can see my mirrored sliding door to my closet on the farthest wall. I remember distinctly that I left one of the sides completely open. 

So I am just staring into space at this, processing being awake. When suddenly, I can see a distinct shape in the darkness of my opened closet door. Upon first noticing this figure I immediately process it as the silhouette of a person. But we all know how creepy that laundry chair in the dark corner of our room can look at night sometimes. Without thinking much of it, I blink my eyes to reprocess what I'm seeing and suddenly the figure is slightly closer, coming out of my closet. Panic ensues, as I rapidly blink again and it is yet again closer. This time I shut my eyes in fear, until I regain courage to open them once more to check that the coast is clear. The figure is out of my closet and much closer, to my horror. My cat is laying beside me, seeming to be asleep but shaking. 

I am overcome with fear at this point, and unable to move. I felt completely conscious, until the figure moved closer and closer until it was right at my bedside and then it dissolved into a black mist over top of me. That's when I froze, and began experiencing the buzzing out noises that the professionals dub 'exploding head syndrome'. 

The figure gave off such a malevolent feeling. He began to speak. It sounded like an older man, and I don't know if it was my childhood brain's thoughts of what old people sound like or what, but it sounded like his voice was playing off of an old record. He asked with anger why I was there, and began to curse at me. I just laid there while this black mass was terrorizing me. It lasted for what seemed like forever, until my alarm went off. Then it was like a flip was switched and everything was back to normal. The dark silence after. I could move again. I turned on every last light I had in my room, and closed my closet door. 

I again didn't know what was happening to me until my 16th birthday. I have so many more stories to share, if y'all are interested. My 16th birthday was also when the out of body experiences started happening. I had it so much, more nights a week than not. And during school too, as I was so exhausted I couldn't sleep. This sleep paralysis figure is the only one that has been reoccurring, all the others I only saw the one time.

Sleepparalysis,"I was about to sleep, but suddenly I realised I couldn’t move like any part of my body.

When I closed my eyes, I saw these flashing images of this one woman, and then later of gods (ik, so random). And I literally couldn’t open my eyes or move my body so I couldn’t stop seeing these flashing images. I literally couldn’t get up or move. It was scary 

There were drawn out sketches of the woman, actual images of the woman, and then at the end there were blue people, for some reason I assumed they were gods. The woman was white with brown hair and there were shots of her with her family also. 

And then when I opened my eyes I could see a creepy odd figure in front of me. 

And then suddenly my brain like blacked out and I just woke up. I don’t even know what happened between the time I was in that state and when I woke up.

Sleepparalysis,"Hey people! I have had this for many years, I know it's not SP but it's the most similar thing I can find. 

On my last experience I woke up on my bed when my bf opened the door to come sleep and while he stood on the door I saw 3 translucid figures around 2m tall, they entered the room and one walked to my side of the bed and stood there standing, then they were gone. I did not feel fear. 

The previous one I woke up in the bed, (bf was playing in another room) and turned my head to see tons of spider nets and spiders next to my head, I screamed and moved away and within seconds they were not there anymore. 

On another one I woke up in the bed (the room was pitch black) and I could see giant walls around me, I sat on the bed and started screaming ""Hello? Help! Help!"" My bf heard me from another room and came to see what was happening, when he opened the door I was sitting on the bed but there were no walls. 

On another one the door of the bedroom was on a different wall and I could see at the end of the hall the living room and a tall figure standing in there, again I did not feel fear. But I was not ""sleeping"" as I sat in the bed. 

It hasn't happened many times, but I can move and talk when it happens and I am usually not afraid, does anyone has any idea?

I had a dream that I was on my sofa with my lil sister besides me. I was still kind of conscious, I was half in the dream I remembered I was both in my room and downstairs where my dream was.  Nevertheless I laid down on the sofa and I couldn’t move. I was getting tickled by something. (In real life I’m resistant to tickeling) I remembered I was sleeping so I woke up, still couldn’t move and now  I felt a entity on me and someone besides me who I tought was sister at first. Wich I both didn’t see but I just felt them. I tried moving my fingers but they didn’t, I pinched in the entity’s finger for a while that was holding me down and I woke up, also I could kind of talk but not with much sound or saying letters I need to close my lips with.

Sleepparalysis,"I'm 25/f and still scared of the dark. 

My 1st wasnt so bad but this one really freaked me out,  I was just falling asleep at 11am because I ruined my sleep schedule learning how to play minecraft, and my bf lay sleeping next to me , I had my phone on an interrogation video for background noise and all of a sudden it's like this crazy vibration and flashing light way in the corner,  I thought my lamp on the desk was gonna burst ( I was thinking it's so loud why hasn't my bf woken up to it ither) but as I try to turn my head to look, it was very difficult to open my eyes and move my neck . I eventually got my eyes open just a lil and it was just pitch black darkness ,mind you the wall next to my bed is like 2 feet away it was like a looming shadow (no specific shape) blob.  I immediately knew what was going on and very much didn't want to look in that direction at all! Then I just felt like I was being pulled off the bed in that direction  but like floating at the same time and off to the front of the bed facing it then I felt like arms wrap around me . If you were sitting on someone's lap style. And just hold me so tight I knew I couldn't scream and I tried moving away just anything to get me out of the darkness.  So I'm staring at my bf sleep alone in the bed and as I try getting back to it is like a water reflection on the ceiling I guess but it shows me in the bed still sleeping. so wierd. but I crawl/ float which seemed like the hardest thing to do to get back to my spot(kinda like going against the current) and finally I lay down agian and I feel his leg with my hand and try to move his leg , I'm trying so hard just to push it and pinch it and nugde it but nothings working (this part felt like it was 7mins btw) simultaneously I'm saying his name over and over and over again but nothings coming out eventually the only thing I saw was black then boom I actually heard myself roughly but softly say his name and my eyes are open and I'm crying lol .

Sleepparalysis,"So i just came out of a nap and got into SP. I usually don’t hallucinate visually because i can’t even open my eyes. Normal SP for me looks just like when you have your eyes closed while being awake. That doesn’t mean it’s pleasant. I get sensations of being poked or stabbed through my mattress or it feels like every inch of my body that’s in contact with my mattress is cramping really intensely. This time however i was able to open my eyes. My room looked like my room but there were LED lights attached to certain places that looked really cool. I even saw an entity. Luckily that entity was my roommate. I tried to communicate to her to wake me up but i couldn’t get any sound out and she just looked at me like she’s trying to figure out what i‘m trying to say. Eventually i pulled myself out of it and as i did she disappeared into thin air. It’s also worth mentioning that i didn’t get any unpleasant sensations whatsoever apart from the usual static feeling. I wish it could always be like that. 

To give context to the setting: my room was illuminated with sunlight and a show i used to watch as a child was on, so the positive mood in the room probably contributed.

Sleepparalysis,"I was up pretty late tonight until around 3 or 4 I can’t remember and I don’t do this all the time but fairly often. I feel asleep after watching YouTube and netflix. But then I had a weird but super realistic dream about my dog and how my dad went to walk the dog and dropped the house keys or something. And then; ok context I am very anxious and get scared super was liter. And like an hour before I fell asleep I thought I heard someone open a card door outside and knock on my window (I know that sounds crazy of me to imagine in my head but that’s how my anxiety works). Anyway because that happened (which my anxiety hasn’t been that bad recently but tbd I seriously believed a car door had opened lol) I thought maybe that’s why I had this freaking demon dream. So basically I heard my door open and I had my eyes closed but I could hear but I can’t remember like feeling my lower body, only my face and right arm. Then this super scary guys voice said something about how he found the keys in the yard and he got in the house and how I couldn’t hide from him. Then I think he said something about how I could pretend to be asleep or actually be asleep but he had access to my house now and he would come back. So I knew I was “awake” but I didn’t try to open my eyes or move at all because I was trying to be “asleep” so the guy wouldn’t escalate. But his voice and his presence felt so real and I hardly ever have dreams and never have nightmares so this was new for me. And when I woke up my body was like numb and I was panting and everything. However I do remember having another dream tonight that wasn’t like that and was just a normal random dream about my family.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi guys, 
There s this thing that started happening to me during my sleep and I don’t know if I should be worried. English isn’t my first language so I ll try to explain it the best I can. It’s been a few weeks now that it first ever happened to me (now it happened between 2 or 4 times). I fall asleep, I start dreaming about something then during that dream it’s as if I gain consciousness. Like, I realize that it’s just a dream, and while the dream is happening, I can see it and I can also start having my other own thoughts as if I was awake. Right after that, I start hearing a « bzzz sound », and I m like no way this is happening again (all while im asleep). So I try to wake up, but my eyes won’t open, the harder I try, the louder the noise gets. It’s a rly loud noise to the point it’s « bothering ». And then suddenly I just succeed at opening my eyes. I look at the time, and realize that I probably just fell asleep not more than 30min ago. Every time it’s the same thing, I dream, I gain consciousness, I hear a buzzing sound, try to wake up, can’t open my eyes. 

Also, one detail that might be important is that I realised this only happens to me during the times I don’t sleep well. Usually I always sleep 6-9 hours a night but the two days prior to today I slept 4 and 2h.

Sleepparalysis,"I’m had chronic sleep paralysis / lucid dreams my entire life but something new happened last night. I think it might be common on this sub but it really scared me
Basically I was falling asleep around my normal time. While I was in that stage, I messaged my friend that passed away last year (he took his own life) and called him. I was staring at his icon and I remember saying, “It’s okay, you can answer, I won’t tell anyone.”
My cat was laying next to me licking herself and I fell into paralysis after thirty minutes. It felt completely different this time..There was this rushing sound in my ears and a really extreme pressure that went from my chest to my ears to my face. When it got to my face I was so scared, it felt like I was having a stroke or something. I couldn’t move and I thought for sure I was going to die. I could hear my cat next to me still licking herself. My entire body felt like it was vibrating and my face was on fire, it was getting hard to breathe. 
I ended up begging for my life in my head and I was.. released. No waking up, nothing, I sat up and caught my breath and cried for a while.

Sleepparalysis,"I just had a sleep paralysis for the first time in my life and... Wtf ? 
To put you into context : I'm staying at my boyfriend's today. He got up this morning to go to college, around 8:30AM. 
I don't have class today and was really tired so I just went to sleep again when he left. 

A moment later, I'm half asleep and hear the front door open. Then the noise my boyfriend's coat does when he takes it off, and the bedroom's door opening. 
He talks to me but I only understand the beginning of his sentence, ""baby, ..."" so I wanted to turn around and answer him but I couldn't move an inch. 
As I didn't talk back, I guess it kinda pissed him, and I heard his steps get closer to the bed, and his breathing. Loud breathing that I also felt on my skin.
I tried to open my eyes, in vain because it was hard, and I had a black filter preventing me to see anyway. 
Then the breathing went in my face, and back in my neck, etc. He was going all around the bed for long seconds. 
I realized in between that it wasn't reality, but it was so scary that I was just hoping and waiting to wake up soon.

Sleepparalysis,"Moved into a new place with my sister when I was in grade 8, slept in my unfurnished room with a few friends on the first night and few nights when my sis had company or I had friends who stayed over. Already started feeling an eerie about this space, which is my space in the house.

Some time during university, coding 'til early hours of the morning. One weekend still not sleeping in my conveniently large room with it's ensuite, because of the feeling of constantly of watched when I enter it or leave my bedroom door open. Sleeping in the small living area in front of a ""constantly on"" television adjacent to my bedroom with bedroom door locked. I'm lying on a mattress, above my head was a window with curtains drawn, no burglar bars, leading to the yard where I would casually walk out from time to time, coz it is a shorter route to the yard or garage. 

TV was always on a music channel, I would listen to music and chat to GF at the time on my Ericsson GA628,  so simple you can navigate the phone with your eyes closed.

I eventually fell asleep and suddenly, All I could hear load static from the TV and can feel a bright light enter the room as if the curtains were open and it was midday, picture a bright light shining on your face when your eyes are still closed. I start feeling the pressure on my chest and something strangling me, I cannot breathe and I cannot move, completely paralyzed. Funny enough, I fell asleep with the phone in my hand, I managed to type a message to my GF and correctly select her contact, I only had a specific contact list on the phone at the time and new exactly which one would be her alphabetically.

I managed to hit send and got a response in that same minute, the phone vibrated and like magic everything returned to the way it was. My music was playing, curtains were drawn and the text I received was ""Pray and cover yourself under the blood"".

Haven't seen my GF on a Sunday, we were only dating for two weeks and spiritual conversion was not a topic at that time in my life.

Sleepparalysis,"I just had the weirdest night of sleep ever. I initially went to sleep at like 11:30 Woke Up Scream and screamed because i saw a dark figure appeared to come towards me but as soon as my eyes adjusted I realized it was nothing. But man that scared the shit out of me my heart was racing. I don’t live by myself but i was telling myself i was scared to live alone which is true lol. 

Anyways for what im trying to understand what just happened this is where it gets weird. I fall back asleep i feel like in like 30 minutes im extremely tired. 
Went Back To Sleep Into What Was The Deepest Sleep Ever. I was dreaming, but I kept sleeping and waking up however I couldn’t really move in this dream. It felt like i was trapped. I questioned if I was dying at one point. To better explain the dream started off with me sleeping in the same room I stay in, in real life. I sleep in the same type of position almost every time. However every time i tried to get up in this dream I would become extremely sleepy: drowsy felt like I was drugged and would fall asleep ended up back in the same position I was at the start (In my room asleep) as if nothing happened. In my room waking up repeating the steps this happened at least 3-4 times I think and felt like a eternity I was fighting to wake up and like walk. At first when woke up I could barely stand up or make it to the door to leave my room and would get drowsy fall asleep and start to wake up in the same position. Then I woke up once took pills as i believed I was sick and I think i took to much, “pills by my bed” I felt i was drugged and didn’t even know how many pills i took i was to fucked up to take them properly. I kept fighting to wake up, I had a phone in the dream and believed i ubered to the house, called the uber back and tried to leave. Of course none of this really happened but driver picks up. Never seen this man in my life but He’s with his son. He FaceTime me he’s here, but i get up im extremely drowsy. I make it out my room but again feeling extremely drowsy like im being pulled back into going asleep. Literally bouncing from wall to wall and thats whats keeping me standing up and when i finally open the door leaving my room the house is different like some Adams family house creepy. I make to the staircase trying to leave but I throw up relentlessly on staircase assuming from the pills. Thats when I questioned dying and I actually wake up this Time 1:43 am and again in my room in the same position i always sleep. And when i woke up took a minute for me to realize i wasn’t in the dream anymore. Felt-like my brain was moving though lol like pulsing but no headache.

So I went to take a wet towel to put it on my head (it was also in front of my eyes) I went back to sleep, I took me a while but I fell a sleep in my back. I had a dream that I was on my sofa with my lil sister besides me. I was still kind of conscious. I laid down on the sofa and I couldn’t move. I was getting tickled by something. I remembered I was sleeping so I woke up, still couldn’t move and now  I felt a entity on me and someone besides me who I tought was sister at first.

Sleepparalysis,"I slept in really late and woke up at about 2:00PM this afternoon and then, drifted off to sleep again. I had a dream that I had done something bad and woke up again. A few minutes later, I drifted off to sleep again and this is when things got really wierd and scary.

I was probably still 80% asleep and 20% awake when this happened but I had this feeling (or dream?) that I was literally dying and could feel the life draining from my body...almost like a dying star in the galaxy that is only a pin-prick of light away from death. It was during this time that I started to panic and think about the dream I had dreamt earlier (where I did something bad) as if it had actually happened and hoped that I wouldn't be punished for it in the afterlife.

As I struggled to hang-on...seconds away from death, I struggled desperately to move my arms...my legs...just anything but my body refused to cooperate as if I was completely paralyzed. I was terrified and desperately wanted to get up and start moving but felt like I was ""trapped"" in a body that would not function. In a last-ditch attempt (when it felt like I only had a second or two of life left in me) I struggled with all my might and was finally able to move and get up.

I was badly shaken and felt out-of-it, wondering what had just happened but managed to get my day started. I did some reading about sleep paralysis but I didn't have an monsters, witches or aliens standing over me or sitting on my chest.

The whole thing was just super creepy and very scary. I don't think I experienced and actual pain or breathing problems during this experience.

Sleepparalysis,"So I wanna start this off by making clear I've only expirienced sleep paralysis once, but it was crazy lucid and idk if the actual paralysis was the first or second ''Nighmare''. 

Anyways, I don't think anything happened that day in order to trigger it, it was a nice day and I was actually having a really nice dream at first. This dream was quite lucid, but I didn't know it was a dream until the very end when it took an extremely dark turn and I didn't wanna be in it anymore. 

So there I was laying in my bed, suppousedly awake now, but something was really off, like the layout of my room was slightly different: my bed was a little bit leaned to the left, the start of the bed was touching my right wall but the rest of it was slightly away. Then suddenly it happened, some random guy literally appeared from the gap between the end of my bed and the wall, he literally got up from there and started running at full speed to the other side of the room; he wasn't anything too terrifying just the silouette of an average man but pitch black. At that point I was already having a panick attack, I could barely see anything anymore because of how scared I was and I suddenly realized that I wasn't able to move and I felt really heavy and weak. I tried to scream for my mom, but I couldn't speak either. Then it finally hit me, I was aware that I was having sleep paralysis and I was desperately trying to calm myself down. I focused on deep breaths and managed to move my arm just enough to turn on the light because I tought that would snap me out of it. It was absolute torture reaching that swicht, it took all my strengh to finally try to flick it but it wouldn't move, and the harder I tried, the louder a humming, kind of like a radio static, got in my ears. There was no way out of it, but I tried to reason with myself, because I knew it couldn't last forever, at some point I would wake up, so I forced myself to it and it surprisingly worked.

This time I woke up for real, but it still was incredibly hard to move and it took a while to regain my mobility 100%, so I wondered if this was the paralysis because I was actually awake, but without hallucionations, and the other thing was just a really vivid nightmare. Btw I'm sorry it got so long, but I didn't know where else to share it.

But how? how could a cat get in? I'm extremely allergic to them. 
I could barely move but i managed to get my feet out of that bed and sprint out of my sister's room. 
I told my dad what happened and he went to check and nothing was there, not under the bed, not under the desk or above it, NOTHING. My head was still spinning until a few minutes ago and my throat was kind of hurting too.
My question is: has anyone else experienced sleep paralysis when you wake up? is it a common thing? because i honestly felt like i was hallucinating or something, i was too awake to have dreamt about it",t2_6xwgmazz,0,i don't have any idea wtf just happened,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,1087aua,True,jeonpendejo,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/1087aua/i_dont_have_any_idea_wtf_just_happened/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/1087aua/i_dont_have_any_idea_wtf_just_happened/,53806.0,1673349166,0,,False,1673349179,1673349180,2023-01-10 11:12:46,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"I know that sleep paralysis can actually be quite common but I’m a little concerned to read in the pinned post that feeling a presence or seeing something is more rare. Where to start? The first time I recall experiencing watching myself sleep I was maybe 11 the view was from the top corner of my room looking down and I didn’t see another person but it was an older woman was speaking to me it was so long ago I don’t remember what she was saying it wasn’t terrifying but it was unsettling. I couldn’t see her but I could feel her there talking to my body I could feel her looking at me I’m not sure how else to describe it but it was almost like maybe she wasn’t aware I was watching/listening from somewhere else if that makes sense. 
I’ve always had really intense, vivid and interactive dreams but the sleep paralysis didn’t start until I was 18 heavily grieving and binge drinking. I remember this first time like it was yesterday it’s almost been ten years, slightly traumatizing I suppose. I fell asleep with the lights on in bed and when I “woke up” I couldn’t move it went from seeing this black figure in my bright room standing at my door (not in any shadows) in the corner of my eye to a third person so I could definitely see him standing in front of me but my body was still on the bed then I went back into my body and I was dragged off my bed onto the floor not by it’s/his hands or anything I just kind of slid off then I was getting spun in a circle under my bed and back slightly out I could see the mattress then my roof. It was intense I felt everything, the spinning, the carpet under me, all of it then I actually woke up for real light still on.
it’s happened a few other times the typical feeling like something is on your bed or weighing you down etc but the two most noteable ones: 1.) walking into my room everything is the same except it’s the middle of the day bright everything is chill until I just feel like something is wrong then I hear a snoring sound coming from under my bed a couple feet in front of me and the terror kicks in I know that this isn’t real whatever is under the bed was the same thing from when I was 18 I go to run out of my room and the hallway/living room is dark it’s nighttime like it’s supposed to be then I’m frozen mid stride and get tossed around until I wake up. 2.) “waking up” in bed the room is dark as it was everything the same except I go to check my phone for the time and it’s dead..I knew it had battery instantly knew I wasn’t truly awake and I didn’t sense anything but it was coming I got up to run upstairs to idk be with people wake someone up. I got to the second level and was frozen again I’m facing forward but my view changes to behind me I see me and the black figure down the stairs then I’m back in my body floated/getting thrown around. 

This dream wasn’t exactly paralysis but I feel it relates. I’m walking a quiet hospitals halls I’m in a gown kind of just checking out the wings and being nosey it goes on for quite awhile then a doctor is trying to grab me he is malevolent I never remember seeing a face but I made myself reappear into another room in the same hospital but I know he’s looking for me and I have the realization that I can’t keep coming back here not to the hospital but this state of dream. It was the same feeling like when I get paralysis that I don’t belong there I need to go back to my physical body. I need to wake up.
Does anybody else feel like they are in another realm when it happens to them? Does anyone else get multiple views of their paralysis?

Ps 95% of the scary stuff happens when I’m withdrawing from alcohol and oddly enough only when I’m alone even if it’s just my dog around it won’t happen.

Sleepparalysis,"This happened a couple months ago but it had me thinking just now. Was this sleep paralysis or a nightmare that felt realistic?

In my “nightmare” I became self aware and believed I was in a simulation. It’s hard to explain but I began taking the headset off of the person “controlling” me. I was the person and at the same time I wasn’t. It was as if the person was wearing a VR headset and I was pulling it off as I was them. The more I pulled the louder this ringing sound kept playing in my ear. My eyes were closed but I could see my arms where they were irl. Meanwhile, I was also seeing my other arms pull this headset off?? I think I was close to taking it fully off before I thought if I took it off I would die. I then kept thinking about my girlfriend and how I didn’t want to die just yet. So I stopped trying to pull it off and woke up scared.

Sleepparalysis,"Ibn Sina, known in the West as Avicenna said:

Ibn Sina said in his medical book al-Qanun: 

Chapter on al-kabus: 

“It is also called al-khaniq (the strangler), and in Arabic it is also called al-jathum and al-naydalan. 

Al-kabus is a disease that a person feels when he is falling asleep and imagines something heavy pressing upon him, squeezing him and constricting his breathing, hence he cannot speak or move, and he is almost suffocated because of the obstruction of his airway. When it goes away, he wakes up immediately. This is the precursor to one of three things: epilepsy, apoplexy or mania. That applies if it is due to physical causes and there is no other non-physical cause.”

Sleepparalysis,"So on Saturday night, (it's now Monday at the time of writing this) I (22f) think I had my first episode of sleep paralysis ever? On Saturday night my boyfriend and I fell asleep earlier than what we usual would on our nights off. We ended up falling asleep on the couch together which isn't unusual for us. He had one of his arms around my torso and the other one underneath me, this is usually how we sleep in our bed or spooning eachother. I try not to sleep on my back typically because I've always been extremely afraid of possibly having sleep paralysis given I had never had it and had only been told about it by friends and family members. I remember ""waking up"" or thinking I was awake at least and hearing what I can only describe as the sound the grudge makes 
right. In. My. Ear.
It was as if someone was laying on the side of me opposite of my boyfriend and just directly making that sound right next to my head. At first I tried to rationalize this, we have ferrets and so we constantly have an air purifier going in the living room next to them. So I told myself that it was that even though I clearly knew it wasn't. I was able to open my eyes and sort of look in that direction. I was aware that I was awake but not, it felt like when you dream that you woke up but you're actually still dreaming only I was fully aware of it. I didn't see anything thankfully because that would've caused me to totally spiral and freak out but I was afraid, especially feeling like someone was right there in my ear.

Sleepparalysis,"So for years and years I have been having (what I think?) is sleep paralysis. 

I’m unsure if this is actually sleep paralysis because I don’t hallucinate and see things at the end of my bed etc, but it’s still pretty scary. 

What happens is that I will be dreaming and then I’ll start trying to wake up pht of the dream because it’s became a nightmare and then I realise I can’t wake up and that im unable to move my body make any noise. I’m completely paralysed and know that I need to wake up but I can’t move anything at all.

For example, tonight i had a dream that turned into a nightmare, i started getting scared and my brain obviously tried waking me up out of the nightmare, but i couldnt wake up and i was trying to scream for my sister to come from next door and wake me up but it wasn’t working, so i was aware my surroundings and that i was trapped in my body essentially. I imagined being able to move but not open my eyes or scream and i was falling around my room in the dream. It was so weird because in the dream i felt like i could actually physically scream but no one was coming to wake me up. 

I have different variations of this, out of the many many times ive had sleep paralysis maybe twice ive imagined someone was in my room or trying to break in and that i couldnt move my body or scream.

It used to only happen very rarely and only if I accidentally fell asleep on my back. I cannot sleep on my back whatsoever bc it happens every time, or I lucid dream, but the line between which of the two happening is so thin I avoid it completely.

But it has recently started happening at least once a week, ive has it twice in the last three days, and it also doesnt just occur at night but also now occurs occasionally if i nap during the day. 

Also, i have it regardless of sleeping on my back now. I never ever sleep on my back and wake up on my side so i know i hadnt been on my back, all of these times it has occurred when sleeping on my side which makes it even scarier because its not like i wake ho on my back and go ahh yea oops, it happens regardless now",t2_kzfea9xt,0,Sleep paralysis at least once a week currently,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,1076nmz,True,user8542689,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/1076nmz/sleep_paralysis_at_least_once_a_week_currently/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/1076nmz/sleep_paralysis_at_least_once_a_week_currently/,53779.0,1673244719,0,,False,1673244731,1673244731,2023-01-09 06:11:59,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"Hey all. Been riddled with sleep paralysis my whole life. Used to happen frequently if I sleep in unfamiliar places. Sometimes being woken up shortly after sleep triggers it. I've had it so often it rarely phases me much anymore. I'm not sure where to post this but I'm starting to have another phenomenon.

As I'm falling asleep, similar to sleep paralysis your thoughts have a more surreal conscious experience. I know my brain is thinking thoughts but as I come to consciousness I can't for the life remember what it was. But I know instead of trying to remember the narrative around the thoughts, to try and remember the emphasized feelings of the thoughts.

It's just been crazy because during these episodes, it almost physically feels like I'm making small plummets on a roller coaster. I'm having crazy thoughts, that trigger intense emotional feelings, that I cannot remember literally seconds after having them.

Sleepparalysis,"Biblical theory of The Hatman.

Some people who encountered this entity claims that the Hatman introduce himself to them as THE DEVIL (in their native languange) 


I want to draw your attention to these verses in the Bible.


In James 2:19 says even demons believe. 


James 2:19 


You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder. 


The Hatman is known throughout the world with two distinguishing features as his identity. the coat and the hat. 


According to verse 1 cor 11:13 


The symbol of the man's head is Christ 


1 Corinthians 11:3 


But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 


1 Cor 11:7 


A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 


The Bible says demons also believe. A man who covers his head while praying shames their head (for the man's head symbolizes Christ) covering a man's head means shaming Christ. Satan doesn't want to honor Christ and dont want to be the image of the glory of God, and this is what this entity portraying. 


1 Corinthians 11:4 


Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.


A man's head is a symbol of Christ. There is also a verse that says our bodies is the temple of God..


""Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple."" 


""Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies."" 


The Hatman's head and body were both covered (hat and coat) as if it was a message that he did not agree with it. Among the shadow people, he is the only one with this kind of details. seems like the Hatman is the one who leads and is superior to these demonic shadow people who attack through sleep paralysis, others claims that some shadow people wears cloaks. ( covering their head and body too) 


God's temple (the body) 


Christ (a man's head) 


Seems that the Hatman and the shadow people is doing the opposite to mock God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 


covering up is a form of hiding or it is something you are ashamed of. 


Remember the story of Adam and Eve? 


God made Adam and Eve naked, until Satan came and tempted the woman to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. there they found out that they were naked and ashamed, God was angry and made them a body covering and they were expelled from the garden of Eden.


 People all over the world have seen this entity (Hatman) in Job 2:2 it says.. 


 Job 2:2 


And the Lord said to Satan, ""Where have you come from?"" Satan answered the Lord, ""From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.


God warned us about the Devil


 1 Peter 5:8
Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.


There is another evil entity associated with the hatman, this entity is called Incubus who sexually assaulted women and some men during sleep paralysis. 

the demon incubus are angels who rebelled against God and went with lucifer (Satan) They became demons and messed with people on earth. these demons were called Nephilims back in the day, who according to Bible married human daughters and gave birth to giants. the word married does not mean having the blessing of the parents but these rebel angels sexually attack the daughters of men on earth which these evil spirit incubus does in sleep paralysis. another term for them is the sex demons. 
It is not surprising why these demonic shadow people according to some accounts are big and taller in height, because they were the origin race of giants on earth who were destroyed by God in the great flood during Noah's time. 

Satan (Lucifer) and the demons have an appointed time. in fact, they  knew that God set a time to punish them. they knew that there is an appointed day for them.

 In Matthew 8:29 it says.. 

And behold, they cried out, ""What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” 

According to my research, some witnesses says the hatman has a pocket watch, some says he carries a suitcase. they say the Hatman has a pocket watch in his hand, and he oftenly check on it as if he is waiting for something.
 Is it because Satan (Lucifer) knows in himself that his day is near? Is this the reason why the devil rushing to do much evil on earth before their appointed time? 


Revelation 12:12


Therefore rejoice, you heavens

 and you who dwell in them!

But woe to the earth and the sea,

because the devil has gone down to you!

He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.”",t2_nw2n11ad,0,Biblical Theory of The Hatman,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,1073u72,True,Neon518,,0,True,,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/1073u72/biblical_theory_of_the_hatman/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/1073u72/biblical_theory_of_the_hatman/,53776.0,1673236344,0,,False,1673236357,1673236357,2023-01-09 03:52:24,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"I hate falling asleep on my back because, every single time I do I undergo SP. The odd thing is that it’s happened so much that I can actually tell when it’s about to happen when I’m sleeping. 

Here’s what happened: SP came into effect, and I could feel a presence next to me in my bed. I felt a hand touch my shoulder (my shoulder is injured) and then proceed to gently push me on my side and then I heard a woman’s whisper saying ‘You’re safe, it’s going to be alright I promise’ and then I drifted off into a very short dream of a wooden cabin style dining room next to a circular window overlooking the mountains, then I woke up. 

I’ve encountered shadow beings, infinite number of pitch black arms holding me down, screaming in my ears, I’ve even heard my own voice become distorted and speak to me with a malevolent tone before during SP. 

This experience was vastly different than the majority of my SP experiences, the hand felt comforting and so did the woman’s voice. I wish more of my experiences were like this. 

On a side note, I’ve been wanting to attempt Astral Projection again but I’m terrified of SP.

Sleepparalysis,"G'day everyone.

I had a case of sleep paralysis last night. Pretty standard stuff, some men and women in old timey posh industrial revolution clothes were standing outside my closed door. I could see their feet and part of their legs because somehow the door had that toilet-style bottom spacing, and it felt obviously ominous as hell.

I wasn't really afraid and started to move toward them, with the intent of slithering beneath the door and get a look at them, and suddenly I couldn't move anymore and fear came upon me.

But although I felt fear, it wasn't my own. I could feel it as if it was my own, but also as if it was being forced on me. It's not the first time I've felt this but it's the first time I have been able to identify it. It is like the paralysis automatically comes with some sense of overwhelming dread and despite fighting against it I can never overpower it (the reason for it I assume now is that it's not mine).

So I just got sleep paralysis this morning after waking up really early and falling back asleep, I normally take seroquel when I go to bed if that's important information.

I could see my room and I realised what my right eye was seeing was like a frozen monitor but not my left eye if i could get it open in the slightest but this is the weird part;
At certain intervals I could move with immense difficulty like as far as getting my head lifted up from my pillow, my eyesight in my right eye would unfreeze then I would go limp again and fall back onto my bed, what I was seeing would freeze like a frozen computer monitor, it kept happening so I could only see the last ""frame"" of what I was looking at and still feel myself falling back. I remember being able to pick up my phone during these intervals which was right next to my pillow and this is where I saw hallucinations in my phone like seeing channels and users that didn't actually exist on my friend's discord server.

Sleepparalysis,"White noise is a type of background noise that can be helpful for sleeping because it can mask other sounds that might disturb you. It can be produced by a white noise machine, an app on your phone or computer, or by simply turning on a fan. Some people find that the steady, monotonous sound of white noise helps them relax and fall asleep. It can also be helpful for people who are sensitive to sudden noises or changes in their environment, as the constant background noise can help to block out these distractions. If you're having trouble sleeping, you might try using white noise to see if it helps

Sleepparalysis,"30 minutes ago, I was lying in bed fully awake. I then closed my eyes to rest them cause I was watching some YT shorts and I turned over to get a bit more comfy. Then I felt my nose getting stuffy and realised me sleeping on my side wasn't comfortable at all, and I was like ""hah, would be a bitch to get stuck in sleep paralysis in this position... Oh wait... shit I'm stuck in sleep paralysis and I haven't even slept"".

Yeah I got stuck in sleep paralysis and I didn't even sleep, must've been entering REM unknowingly just lying there fully conscious. Took me a good 20 minutes to get up cause I was supposed to have lunch with the fam.

Like many in this sub, I get sleep paralysis on a fairly frequent basis. I'd say in a week I'd probably get maybe 1 or 2 good night's of sleep without experiencing it but for the most part I have gotten used to waking up as a vegetable. As far as hallucinations go, they're generally about me waking up and regaining control of my body only to reset shortly and I'm still stuck in bed which is a bit of a troll. This type of sleep paralysis has been happening to me for at least 6 years now (I'm 21).

All of that isn't the most scary part, the problem is I reposition during sleep and often wake up with a stuffy nose and in an uncomfortable position. Many times I have felt suffocated and breathing as hard as I can through my stuffy nose unable to breathe through my mouth. What I'm saying is I'm afraid one day I might wake up and die of asphyxiation. And if anyone either has advice or experienced something similar.

Sleepparalysis,"I have been having sleep paralysis ever since my dad passed back in 2011, I have also been a big weed user since before then. Ive noticed that while im heavy in smoking my sleep paralysis doesnt really come around as often, but if I stop then it comes back. I am on my honeymoon and the first night I went to sleep with no weed and had two incidents back to back. Thankfully im in jamaica so was able to get weed the next day. I also went to a medium beginning of 2021, and the way she explained my dad visiting me in my dreams just felt a lot like sleep paralysis. The times he does visit me always feel so real but I know these instances arent sleep paralysis. Most of the time ill wake up or think im awake but im in my bed cant move, cant yell or breathe, then I awake up again and im finally back in reality. When the medium first approached my mom way back when (thats another story) she told her that he was a good spirit and that we had nothing to fear so I dont think he is the ""demon"" in my sleep paralysis.

Sleepparalysis,"Excuse bad grammar and spelling I am terrible with those for no reason

I’ve experienced sleep paralysis since I was 15. The first time it happened I didn’t understand what was happening. I though I was either having a seizure or being possessed. I remember struggling so hard to move and rolling onto the floor only to wake up still in my bed. When I was 15 this was a daily occurrence. I took me months to learn what it was

One time I hallucinated there was a sort of demonic entity in my room. It crawled onto my bed and clawed at me and ripped me open. The scariest part is I felt all of the pain. And I went to school the next day and felt it on my body. Obviously psychological but still scary

Another time I came home from school and lied on my bed. My at the time boyfriend boyfriend called me and I picked up. We had a full conversation about whatever. At one point I said something and he didn’t answer. I said “hello” a few time before going to look at my phone. It wasn’t there. I found it at the end of the bed. It felt sooo real. Idk if that is considered sleep paralysis but it was definitely a state between sleep and awake hallucination. 

Those are just a couple examples that stick with me, but I did experience this daily for about a year, and now it’s still a couple times a month

Anyway to my advice. After a while i would wake up in sleep paralysis, and immediately, understand what is happening I’d either wait for it to pass, or wiggle a toes to make it go by quicker. The best thing I learned recently is that you are in a state between awake and asleep. You can choose to just go back to sleep can simply go back to sleep, and immediately be lucid freaking. For me, it worked every time without fail. I really wish I knew this when I experienced this every day!! Lucid dreaming is amazing

Sleepparalysis,"Okay so recently I have been experiencing this and I think it has happened maybe three times already and it freaks me out-

So sometimes when I'm sitting down watching something I'll get really tired so I will just take a nap/ or I'll accedentally fall asleep. Which is obviously a normal thing- but so far, everytime I fall asleep during that time, I'll be in a dream- somewhat conscious of it most way not, cause it's a dream, and I just want to say that normal for me. But then, when I can feel myself coming out of the dream it's like I'm stuck in this, void? It's black and there's nothing, I feel awake but I can't open my eyes, I can't move, I can't speak, even if I scream until I'm not able to scream anymore.

Half the time when I fall asleep there's someone in the room with me irl cause I remember that they were chilling in my room with me before I fell asleep. So when I'm in this void like space I remember they are there so I try to yell at them so they can help me but they can't hear because I can't speak or move my mouth. Nothing but hearing my own faint screaming in my head and it makes me panic more.

Another thing to add is that when I'm in the ""void"" it's like I'm drowning underwater, background noise irl is muffled so I can slightly hear and there's a strong pressure on my chest, making it hard to breathe and makes me feel totally paralyzed. And although it feels like that, I'm not actually underwater, in the ""void"" but it's what it feels like.

I'm writing this after I just had another experience with it so I can talk about it with a fresh mind. And this is the only ever time I was able to move my right hand a little bit, I don't know if it was irl or just in the ""void"" but it felt real- but it was really hard to move because I feel held down/into place, even though I feel like I'm upright, which is why I mention in the beginning that I'm still sitting in a chair so I'm somewhat upright.

 And I just want to note further that it's extremely scary to go through in the moment and that's why I'm writing it now, because if I write this later I'll make myself think that it's not a big deal and not as terrifying as it actually was. If anyone can help, that would be really appreciated haha .. (⁠;⁠ŏ⁠﹏⁠ŏ⁠)",t2_kxp9lul1,0,Can someone tell me if what I'm experiencing is sleep paralysis or something similar?

Sleepparalysis,"I know everyone hear probably hates this question, and I did read the post about identifying sleep paralysis. I still want to ask you as I feel my experience was both more simple and more complicated due to other factors that may not typically come into play.

Basically, I had woke up in the morning and come down to sit on the couch. I guess I was tired still because I fell asleep which is really weird for me as I don't nap. When I woke up I was slumped over to the side and had my phone on my lap. I could see the messages popping up on my phone from people texting me but couldn't move my body. I was completely conscious but my brain was really foggy and I was having a hard time staying focused on any coherent thought. 

During the time I couldn't move my grandma had come upstairs (she lives in our basement) to do her laundry on our top floor. This normally takes her about 10-15 minutes. I remember wanting to do something that would draw her attention to me to help me but being unable to move or speak. Eventually she went downstairs and after a bit more time passed I regained my ability to move though I still felt rather out of it. 

If it was just as simple as this I would have assumed I probably did just have an episode of sleep paralysis, but the thing that has always left me wondering is that at the time of the episode I had just returned from spending 10 days in the hospital. I'd had to get a surgical feeding tube and ended up with refeeding syndrome. As a part of the refeeding syndrome I'd had several seizures in the hospital, all of which were the kind where my body convulsed, but I also experienced the same sensation of not being able to move or speak and being able to think but not very clearly. 

The day I had this event I ended up having to go back to the hospital as they'd believed I'd got refeeding syndrome a second time from coming home and beginning to eat again orally while I had been NPO in the hospital besides the tube feeds, so I'd basically doubled my caloric input in 24 hours. 

So I guess I'm wondering if this experience would line up with sleep paralysis. I feel like it would have been way too long to be another seizure because of how long my grandma was upstairs (it was also different as I didn't convulse like I did in the hospital), but I've also never had an episode of sleep paralysis before or since and I think the timing was weird. It also happened in the morning when I'd already been awake and active and had just drifted off which is unlike me. 

Anyway, I'm really sorry as I'm sure these posts are so boring and dreaded by your subreddit. It's also so long which I also feel bad about! So sorry! I've just been really curious about this for about a year, so I really hope someone is willing to share their insight. Thank you!",t2_874yfkft,0,Bear With Me Please....

Sleepparalysis,"Wondering if anyone has noticed similar symptoms as me. I've always thought it was strange that most people's recounts of SP involve something along the lines of the old hag (something on your chest) and/or hallucinations. I've personally never felt something on my chest, and rarely have hallucinations.

Almost always, my sp happens when I'm falling asleep (hypnagogic) rather than when I'm waking up (hypnopompic). When it happens while falling asleep I never hallucinate, I just sudden realize I can't move and go into an instant panic attack. The only thing I can control is my breathing and make a sort of gasping noise. I try to gasp as loud as possible because if my wife wakes up and touches me, I immediately snap out of it. She hates it, lol, it scares her too.

The rare times it happens when waking up, that's when I have hallucinations. Usually they're auditory, although there's been a couple visual ones, still nothing ever on my chest. Last night's was the strangest auditory one I've experienced. It happened while waking up, I heard a phone bell ringing in the hallway. Like one of the older physical metal bells. It kept ringing an uncomfortable amount of time, and then I suddenly realized it wasn't a bell ringing, it was my wife breathing. Every time she was breathing in is when I was hearing the bell. However, the next time she breathed in, it got really eerie. She just... Kept breathing in. Like instead of the in-out cadence, it was just permanently breathing in like one big long infinite breath. That's when I started to panic and hyperventilate until she woke up and shook me out of it.


That's a bit long winded, but what I'm wondering is a few things below. 

1. Has anyone else noticed similar, where hallucinations only occur on wake?

2. Do you usually experience SP on sleep or wake?

3.

Sleepparalysis,"So, my sleep paralysis started when I was 16 every night for a year, since then it happens at random. Sometimes I hate it, and sometimes I love it. One of my favorite experiences is when it happens as I fall asleep. It can cause some of the best lucid dreams. 

I had it happen last night. It's like I'm conscious and watch myself fall asleep. I see nothing but a swirling darkness and can physically feel my whole body and mind swirling with it. It's a nice feeling. As the dream visuals start I get to control what I see.

Sleepparalysis,"I keep dreaming where a person’s is physically molesting me. In my culture, people do all these things to others, like they become an incubus or succubus for you, some even legally marry you without your knowledge and they serve as a source of demonic entry into your life. We call it having spiritual wife or a spiritual husband. 10/10 times, it’s a real person who has a contract with a demon that’s attacking you.

I feel the near physical manifestations as if there’s someone there molesting me. It has a strong grip over me and I don’t know what to do about it. I think it’s someone from my tribe who is involved in the dark arts that’s coming after me.

The person I suspect ( to be the spiritual incubus / succubus) used to consistently call me their husband and used to act seductive towards me. Now I see the same emotional affection from  a seducing spirit that now has a strong grip over my day to day emotions. The spirit molests me while I’m by myself and ruins my mood. They also have jokingly threatened me spiritually that if i take a girlfriend or a spouse, they’d kill such a spouse. I am in a dark situation, my mouth and crotch are usually in pains and I-feel used and molested. I am so disgusted with myself and my self confidence and emotional strength have gone down the drain. 

They have also threatened to  establish their own marital plans for my life, so they can keep a firm grip on my success, they wanna serve as an eternal source of limitation to my life.

Sleepparalysis,"So I made the dumb decision to stay up late and I already know that that is always the leading cause of my SP episodes, but this was the worst one i've had so far. 

As I was falling asleep ""pre-episode"", I already had like loud auditory hallucinations (this is normal for me i get auditory hallucinations all the time before falling asleep) as i was about to slip into slumber but these were really loud and woke me up. The first one was a loud brass instrument and the second one was a huge bang in my right ear. 
So then I finally fell asleep. I wasn't on my back i was actually cuddling a pillow on my side, next thing I know i'm lucid but having sleep paralysis. So I'm not sure because i've never recorded myself during a sleep paralysis episode, but I am pretty sure that i am able to move just not my whole body or eyes or wake up. 
So as I am laying there, I start to feel physical pain in my neck. I listen really closely and i can hear and barely feel myself gripping the pillow, and then I kick both my feet because I am trying to wake up but you know, nothing happens. And then I try to open my eyes but can't even manage to get them open for a second. Then all of a sudden I'm like out of body and can see like a hand or something poking into neck and causing the pain and it really hurt so I just start slowing my breathing and taking deep breaths to calm myself down and endure the pain and then I snap awake. 

Is this some other form of sleep paralysis? Google definition is that you cannot move at all so maybe i'm lucid moving but I could hear myself kicking and gripping the pillow but idk.

Sleepparalysis,"This happened last night. I woke up in the middle of the night with a very intense headache. As soon as I woke up, I realized my jaw was tightly clenched (I wear a thick retainer for grinding) and that was causing my pain. The scary part was I could not unclench my jaw. My jaw was frozen or paralyzed (?). After about a minute I was able to unclench and open my mouth. It was a pretty scary experience and I’d like to figure out what caused it.

Sleepparalysis," I have had sleep paralysis as an adult on and off for the past 26 years. There have been periods of months or even years where I didn't have any and times where I had a few relatively close to each other. This week alone, I have had 3. It was the one from last night that was absolutely the worse ever.   Before I try to describe it, I want to say that I do not think these can or should be shrugged off as totally explainable by science. There are either people of that school that think it is all physiologically and psychologically fused and that people who believe they are actually happening to them are just being ridiculous. Then there are those that are more accepting of it but condescend and say things like, “These people really believe that this is truly happening to them.” Both groups will say “It's completely harmless.”   To them I say  it SURE DOESN'T FEEL HARMLESS. And it absolutely is happening to me. How could it be any other way? Whether you think its real or not doesn't mean shit to me because I'm the one it's happening to. And man, IT IS HAPPENNING to me. How can anyone say what's real or not anyway. Something that happened a year ago is nothing now but a memory. Just like these experiences are now a memory. The only difference is that what happened a year ago (whatever it may have been, pick any widely known news bit) in the world was something we all remember, a memory shared by the masses. But it's not happening now. It's just a memory agreed upon. So “it happened”. As soon as that becomes individual, as soon as it is subjective, people will say “it didn't really happen, You only think it happened. You only believe it happened.”   Look, I don't “think” it happened. I don't “believe” it happened. IT HAPPENED.  Just because it didn't happen to you doesn't make it any less real to me.  In fact, when they do happen, it's more real than real could possibly be, it's hyper real, it seems more real than anything when I'm awake. As far as I'm concerned, and I believe that many will agree with me, these experiences and these entities are absolutely real. Anyone that has had these can at least understand where I'm coming from. 

 Anyway, here is the one from last night:  Like the other night, I felt the sensation of my blanket pulling upwards off me and I felt my spirit was coming up out of my body and felt a sense of elation. But then, the covers start to pull down off of me onto the floor at the foot of the bed. I went from excitement to terror beyond description. There was an entity. It was a woman. She had no distinguishable characteristics of such but I knew that it was a woman. I could feel the female energy. Her form was like a black hole, just pure dark dark blackness with little bits of dim light fluttering about and off of her and where a face would be, it looked like faces were being projected onto her, they were always changing and multifaceted and terrifying. She knew I was trying to get past the bedroom door, out into the hallway where the little butterfly lamp is but she wasn't letting me past. The level of fear was unbelievable. I felt that she had the power to control my fear and she was cranking it off the dial. I tried off the charts. I was lashing out at her trying to throw blows and screaming “Get Off! Fuck you bitch demon!” It had no effect on her that I could tell. I was trying to invoke the name of the Lord, trying anything. That only seemed to amuse her. I could feel her laughing at me, toying with me.  I felt this was going to go on and on forever, felt myself being drained and getting weary but eventually I started to wake very slowly. I could hear myself yelling out  but it was like my mouth was full of oatmeal or something. I sounded weird. I tried crying out, hoping one of the kids would hear me and come in to shake me awake but it just sounded like a loud moaning, like my speech was being stifled by her. While this was happening, her form morphed into a two dimensional face on the ceiling. She was upside down form my viewpoint, her hair was flying out in all directions and those ever changing faces... I eventually regained the strength to pull the curtain away and turn my lamp on. I was just about in tears and said out loud “What... was that... Thing.” I refused to lay back down for half an hour. When I did I opened my bedroom door so the light from the butterfly lamp provided a dim light. It used to be that when I had these episodes, L would shake me awake and I did the same for. Without her there to shake me, these are lasting so much longer than they needs to. (Note: “L” is my late wife. And no, I'm not having these as some subconscious effect of grief. She died a bit over two years ago and I've had these for two and a half decades before that.)",t2_6aseydvg,0,Editorial / Latest SP Experience,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,10570xz,True,klombieX2,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10570xz/editorial_latest_sp_experience/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/10570xz/editorial_latest_sp_experience/,53731.0,1673042708,0,,False,1673042723,1673042724,2023-01-06 22:05:08,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"Sorry for the long story. It’s my first time posting, and I wanted to see if anyone has had a similar experience. 

I’ve had sleep paralysis most of my life. It started happening in my teenage years and was typical symptoms, pressure on my chest, inability to move and the dark figure in the corner of the room. 

But as I got older, it started to change, the pressure moved from my chest into my head, and the dark shadow disappeared. Instead, I started seeing people.  I would lay in bed watching them go around their business while I was trying to force my limbs to move. They never noticed me. They just did their own thing has their conversations, which I couldn’t hear, and as soon as I could move, they would disappear.  

Then one night, I woke up and instead of seeing people, I saw 4 shadows huddled in the corner of my room talking. Again I didn’t pay too much attention to them I just started focusing on my toes, trying to move so I would snap out of sleep paralysis and go back to normal sleep. But one of the shadow people noticed I was awake and floated near me. It didn’t seem happy that I was awake. It reached out and touched my hip. When it made contact with my skin, I felt the sharpest pain run through my hip, I screamed and snapped out of sleep paralysis, and the shadow people disappeared. 

Since I saw these 4 shadow people, my sleep paralysis has started occurring more often. I no longer see shadows or people instead I hear voices, but I can’t understand what they are saying. My brain goes into overdrive, trying to wake my body up. I panic and this causes the pressure on my head to intensify until I wake up screaming.",t2_56jv5lxs,0,Has anyone experienced different types of sleep paralysis throughout their life?,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,1053o66,True,ruz_puz,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/1053o66/has_anyone_experienced_different_types_of_sleep/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/1053o66/has_anyone_experienced_different_types_of_sleep/,53730.0,1673034818,0,,False,1673034834,1673034834,2023-01-06 19:53:38,,,,,,,,,

But this time, it was way too fucking far.

I've had incepting dreams before but this time it went so deep I half-question me typing this.

I must've ""woken up"" and realized I was still trapped in a dream at least three times, all leading to their own individual sleep paralysis episode.

But the very last one, the one I truly woke up from, was probably the worst attack by far.

It used to be that I felt like I was *going* to die.

Sleepparalysis,"As a kid I never saw or heard anything. I'd get an episode 1 or 2 times a month til I was 18. All that would happen was I'd wake up staring at the wall and could feel an immense pressure as if something was pushing down really hard on me. Like a weight was on me but perfectly distributed on every square inch of my body.

Then I turn 18, and had an episode where a voice screamed at me to ""Burn in hell"" extremely loud. So loud that if it actually happened my parents from the other side of the house would've bust in my room a minute later asking what the FUCK was that. 

After that my episodes were a lot less frequent. Anytime I'd have an ""episode"", I'd just get a really odd ""tight"" feeling in my forehead and be unable to move for a bit. I'd have to wiggle free and that was it.

Few weeks ago though I had an episode where I was awake but my eyes wouldn't open. I began to hear a ""dog"" circling around me. Growling and snarling in a very nasty, threatening, sinister manner.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve experienced sleep paralysis two times in my life and they have been not necessarily the scariest things but the most uncomfortable things i’ve ever experienced while sleeping. The first time was a few months ago, (around 6), and I was having a dream where I was teaching my freshman history teacher how to play the saxophone lol. Then i’m in a car with a person and I say, out loud in my dream, “Wait, i’m dreaming right now!”. The person in the car with me turns and says “You shouldn’t have said that” (or something along those lines) then I proceed to enter my first episode of sleep paralysis. I can slightly open my eyes, and I see i’m in a completely different room than my bedroom. There’s a painting on the dark green walls, similar to the Mona Lisa, and the worst thing about this was this loud music/buzzing noise that was unbearable. It only lasted a few seconds but it was awful. My second experience was this morning. I was sick so I took the day off, then went back into my bed and was watching something on my phone and I started drifting off to sleep. In this dream I had, I was at my grandparents house and sitting in my grandfathers usual recliner, was my dead great-grandmother. She looked so happy as I remember and she just smiled at me. I stood up to go talk to her but she disappeared and was replaced by my dad. In the dream, I was trying to explain to my mom that I saw “grammie” and I was shaking and crying in my dream but I could also feel myself doing it in my bed. I’m hyperventilating at this moment and i’m trying to wake myself up when I enter my second episode of SP. This time i’m in my normal room but I can barely open my eyes, I can’t move a muscle and I hear the same music/buzzing sound. I gained full consciousness but was a little freaked out.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello, my first post here.
I've had episodes of Sleep paralysis for as long as I can remember. Never too frequently, but at least multiple times a year, going all the way back to childhood.
I can still so vividly remember these terrifying nightmares as a kid where I'd be unable to move and feel.... something in the room with me. It wasn't until relatively recently, as in a few years ago, that I learned what SP even is, and it was such a ""ohhhh"" moment, when the pieces finally slid into place and I realized that's what I've been having.
I've never physically seen the SP demon, as a kid I'd always sleep with the covers over my head out of fear, a habit I carried into adulthood but more for comfort then anything else. It's just nice to bundle up, so I've never seen it, but I've always felt it, and heard things. As a kid I'd even always shut my bedroom door hoping to keep the demon out.
My episodes have been less often recently, since my partner has moved in with me. They toss and turn like a wild animal at night, so I can't seem to slip into SP very often thankfully. There's still times where I take a nap, or go to bed before then where an episode hits. 
I had a really bad one a few years ago while they were in the room with me. The feeling of being trapped, and helpless while they're just five feet away and couldn't help was terrifying. Even worse cause I was convinced the demon would go for them if I didn't wake up.
Just now, I awoke from an episode and thought to look for this reddit and post here.
I was just laying down for a nap before work, and felt myself slip into SP, panic quickly set in, and I felt my heart racing. I tried telling myself to calm down, and to focus on moving my finger tips. When I felt the presence enter the room and sit in my partners chair. I heard it speak, and it was my partners voice. I knew it wasn't actually them, they left for work a few hours ago. I told myself it wasn't them, and the demon responded to my thoughts. ""Your right""
In my 25 years of life, as far as I can remember the demon never actually spoke to me directly, so this scared the absolute shit out of me, especially using my loved one's voice and especially when I felt it get up from the chair and approach the bed. I couldn't see it, but I could feel it coming closer and closer, until I snapped awake, only to slip right back into the SP where I heard the demon again, this time when I woke up I got out of bed to first text my partner, and then come here.",t2_7xqmgg8b,0,A life of sleep paralysis,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,104y6f7,True,artist-GJ,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/104y6f7/a_life_of_sleep_paralysis/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/104y6f7/a_life_of_sleep_paralysis/,53727.0,1673021837,0,,False,1673021851,1673021851,2023-01-06 16:17:17,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,So before my sleep paralysis happened like the day before I had a dream about a five-eyed female with blonde hair toddler I was on some sort of balcony with a moving belt type thing that moves boxes around I saw this thing at the bottom of this balcony thing which felt alive.... Then before I woke up this boy baby just spawned right out of my peripheral vision as soon as I saw it I use my foot and sort of moved it like you scared me get away from me sort of thing then I woke up just before school..... Then the day after the day of my sleep paralysis thing I was woken up at abt 2:13 a.m. buy a enormously strong the strongest amount of someone's staring at me I've ever felt  then I saw in the same instant a tall black human like figure standing next to my bed staring out my window void of all light and my body felt like when your leg falls asleep that static my entire body felt like that I tried to do something even make a noise but I couldn't then I tried something which has worked before and lucid dreaming you squint your eyes to wake up because sometimes when you squint your eyes in the dream you do it in real life for some reason and when I closed my eyes I saw the black void of all light thing right up in my face I could see its teeth but it didn't look like it had all of them it look like I had one really big one like an anime then I heard it in the most unhuman way possible that said wake up and I immediately woke up after you said that and he was gone and 6 minutes before that I got a text from someone I rarely get to talk to we didn't talk about much we played video games nothing life altering or at least that's what it seems but for some reason I don't think that was luck I don't know how but I think that thing was sent here to wake me up and it changed the course of time it altered my future... I started getting bloody noses after that not all the time but a lot more than I used to and I feel like if I just couldn't move and just had that static feeling in my body that is probably sleep paralysis but this seemed too real and that feeling of someone watching me was too much for me to handle it was so immense and now that I saw that I realize that I've always had a feeling that someone is watching me I'm just noticing it more now not just when I'm alone..... I used to live in a very small neighborhood next to a Creek in a forest and anytime I would go in that Forest I would see that same exact demon that I saw in sleep paralysis out of the corner of my eye but every time I look it would not just disappear it would make it seem that I was imagining it because why I stopped to look there wasn't anything even in the shape of that thing.,t2_9sq4l2xy,0,my experience,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,104sbri,True,speedgod1oo,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/104sbri/my_experience/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/104sbri/my_experience/,53724.0,1673006043,0,,False,1673006058,1673006059,2023-01-06 11:54:03,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"It’s 3am… I took 3 25mg diphenhydramine before bed because I knew I wasn’t going to be able to fall asleep right away and to add to that I was feeling very anxious before falling asleep (I felt like I heard breathing and felt a… “presence”).

I experienced sleep paralysis but in my dream. I would wake up then fall back asleep going in and out. It was the same feelings and cycles as SP but fully in a dream (I thought I was waking but I wasn’t). In my dream I woke up and felt cum in/on my butthole. I kept getting a feeling of pain down there which is why I checked because I had the question. In my dream I talked to my sister who mentioned helping someone she shouldn’t have and the someone came to her and made her an unwelcome poster that scared her (sort of like an excited to meet you and have a relationship with you) and put it on her wall. I wonder if I (unknowingly) helped a demon when I fantasized with one. But you know these things… it could all be in your head. But for those who believe in these things I have in the past masturbated and “did what I was told” of thoughts I heard in my head.

The biggest thing is this last part. After that I was trying to explain what was happening and looking for help. I felt a pain in my bum and heard a high pitched noise and it brought me to the brink of near agony and just kept me/held me there. I understand you can’t feel physical pain in your sleep but I still felt a type of pain and it was as if I was descending to the depths of hell. 

I woke up inhaling as if I had sleep apnea and was holding my breath. I do not sleep with anyone to verify this. I’ve also been keeping myself celibate these past several days so that could be adding to the issue as well. 

The main thing is that I’ve never experienced pain and torture to that extent in a dream and it was in tandem with those… “findings”. It truly made me wonder if this is a thing others have experienced and how real it could be (or perhaps there is a way to heal psychologically). 

P.S. After I woke up I still heard that 6th sense faint breathing. Sometimes I wonder if my bipolar causes me to be more in tuned/sensitive to these things.",t2_7j07kosw,0,Can you get raped by a demon in your sleep?,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,104pvcn,True,OddPoet2610,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/104pvcn/can_you_get_raped_by_a_demon_in_your_sleep/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/104pvcn/can_you_get_raped_by_a_demon_in_your_sleep/,53719.0,1672997274,0,,False,1672997284,1672997284,2023-01-06 09:27:54,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"I was falling asleep watching TV led on the sofa, decided to get up and go to bed but before I moved I *blinked* was hit with the vibrating wave which sweeps my body as I become paralysed everytime. It was a loong blink but as I slowly opened my eyes back up, there it was.  
At first I thought it was a person, stood about 6ft tall but it was dressed in a bright white robe type thing and had a babirusa's (boar with tusks) head which was as white as the robe.

Sometimes it takes me forever to break free from SP, usually by mustering up breath to shout a random weird noise, but the pure fear of seeing this quickly let me roar ""NOOOO"" and I was free and it just vanished on the spot.

Has anybody else seen a white robed figure with a boars head and tusks? 


Small bit of info since this is my first post here: my sleep paralysis always happens when i’m falling asleep, never when already asleep/waking. Every time even with my eyes open I feel a wave of vibration through my body as the paralysis spreads instead of being instant all over paralysis. Most times i’m quick enough to repeatedly clench my fist to prevent SP but sometimes it happens too fast and the only way out is to try and control my breathing enough until I can shout loudly to get out.",t2_41zjyit8,0,After 8 years of SP I finally saw a 'demon'.

Sleepparalysis,"I thought I’d share my story for anyone who wants to read it. A forewarning, it’s pretty terrifying and I believe it checks most of the boxes for SP. I put NSFW in case anyone is scared by this so I don’t get a bunch of messages that it was triggering or whatever.

In 2013, my wife and I were married. We got a motel room in Copper Harbor, MI to celebrate our honeymoon. We spent the day drinking and we both took some LSD in the afternoon. Most of our trip was at the beach and it was nothing short of magical. As the day wound down, we went to the bar. Eventually my wife grew tired and went back to our room an hour before me. I had a few more drinks and chatted with locals and other tourists. I went back to the room around 1am and started watching tv with a lamp on but I set the timer for the tv. I have no recollection of getting sleepy. It was like a seamless transition to a party in our room. My wife was gone and there was a homely girl sitting at the end of our bed and other faceless people partying in the room. The girl had a piece of wood in her hands and she was gnawing on it like it was a cob of corn. She had stubby sharp teeth. Then a guy sat down on the end of the bed and looked at me. His eyes lacked humanity and his face resembled Baraka from Mortal Kombat. His head was shaved and he had stubble on his face. Suddenly he was on top of me and his weight was crushing. I couldn’t move and I felt his dick pressed against me. It went from my waist up to my chest and felt enormous. He stared into my eyes and screeched into my face like the Nazgûl from LOTR. I screamed as loud as I could, “Get the fuck off me!” and sat up. I was now awake and my wife was laying next to me passed out and the tv was off, but the lamp was still on. There was nobody else in the room. I was drenched in sweat and my heart was racing. I layed back and the second I hit the pillow I was right back in the dream and the demon was still on me. I struggled for a couple seconds and then it just vanished. The faceless people now had faces and I asked the closest person to me where the demon went. The person told me there was no demon in the room. I asked them about the girl eating the wood and they said, “That’s the devil’s bitch”. That’s the last thing I remember and then I woke up and it was morning. I told my wife and friends the story and a friend of mine told me it was sleep paralysis and that he had a similar experience of being held down but his demon had a face made out of clock gears and galaxies. At that point in my life, I rarely had dreams. This summer I started dreaming again but never anything scary like that.

Sleepparalysis,"What are yours scary experience with SP?here’s mine 🥲

Lately I can tell if I’m slipping into Sleep paralysis, and I would wake myself up. There’s like this ringing noise that only happens when I’m slipping into SP. 

One night, I let myself go into my Sleep paralysis state. Fortunately for me, I don’t experience seeing anyone or a shadow, it’s mostly I can’t move or I hear some voices of my parents. 

As realize I’m in my SP state, my eyes are closed. I instantly chanted in my head ‘DONT THINK OF ANYTHING SCARY!’ As I calmed myself down, I slowly opened my eyes. And I saw my ceiling, I looked around my room and thankfully saw nothing.

I closed my eyes again trying to go into a lucid state, and I tried to think of something pleasant. As I was thinking, I felt myself float   Upwards off my bed, and I was panicking so bad. To my dismay as soon I started panicking I heard my parents voices arguing, I tried to say “mom” but I couldn’t open my mouth. The voices got louder and closer to my room, I start to try to wake myself up. 

Then the voices just stops and the knocking on my bedroom door came. I can hear my moms voice saying, “Are you awake? La, Are you awake?” I’m trying to speak but I couldn’t. Then the banging on my door came, I can see the door rattle by the banging. Now my mom is screaming while banging the door “ARE YOU AWAKE?! LA”

I close my eyes once more, and I begging myself in my head for me to wake up. My toes were the first to move, and I’m just trying to wiggle my toes so fast. I tried biting my lip, to see if I could have a reaction to pain. Then I softly murmured “stop” then I remember falling softly on my bed, the banging on the door stopped and I then awoke.

I woke feeling sweaty and breathing heavily. Then I started laughing to myself grateful that it wasn’t real.

Sleepparalysis,"For people who have had multiple/regular sleep paralyses, have you ever noticed a pattern in what causes you to get sleep paralysis?
I have just realized it most commonly---in fact, *only*---happens to me when 1. I'm napping and 2. It's a very bright setting (it's daytime and my blinds are open, or my big ceiling light is on...). I can't recall a single time sleep paralysis happened to me at night---which I'm grateful for, because I'm a big nyctophobe and I would probs have the worst ever time of my life. The frequency with which I've been getting them has multiplied tenfolds since I entered college which I assume may mean they also could either stem from stress or lack of sleep

I want to try out napping in the dark more often. Because I have mild insomnia, I tend to get really sleepy during the day and therefore fall asleep whenever. But I think this could def improve my ""condition"". But also I do want to try and induce SP myself by replicating these conditions to try and lucid dream...

Second question is---Have you noticed some ""themes"" often coming back when you're in SP? In my case, there's often a sense of urgency which exacerbates the panic. I have to call my mom or the ER, I have to get up and hide because I've heard someone in my house while I'm meant to be home alone, etc, etc. They've become less pronounced because I'm now able to recognize I'm paralyzed and therefore only focus on waking myself up.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello. I don't know if this is the right place for this but since i experienced sleep paralysis as a teen it was the closest thing i could think of. Twice this week i was waking up hearing scratching noises on the right side of my bed, and feeling my blankets physically being pulled off the side of the bed. I could hear the sound of them sliding over my bed and pajama. I really feel like the blankets were actually being pulled as when i started waking up they were still fully covering me, while by the time i was starting to be more aware my legs were no longer under the blankets and my torso was only still covered by a small part of my 2 person blanket. My bedroom is cold, if the blankets were off my legs even a short time my legs would have been cold pretty fast, they were still warm though. Also at no point was i unable to move or speak, unlike the bouts of sleep paralysis i had during teenage years where i could not even make a sound, let alone move. Is this still possibly sleep paralysis? Or should i just start setting up a camera? It scared me pretty bad and I am unsure what to do. Should i ignore it or pay attention? Is it sleep paralysis or not? I got a bunch of questions and am quite a little freaking out to be honest.

Sleepparalysis,"About half a year or so ago I was afraid of falling asleep at night because of reading spooky high strangeness stuff. I would often put my light on to sleep and sleep with earbuds in. As expected, this made me very tired during the day and so I would often take a nap. 

My biggest fears were opening my eyes and seeing something I didnt want to see, so I made it a habit to fall asleep with my feet holding down the bottom of my blanket, and the sides tucked underneath my torso. I would fall asleep on my stomach with my head to one side.

Then one day, during a nap, something strange that I had never experienced nor was expecting ever to happen before happened. Sleep paralysis started, something walked/crawled or something up my back, poked its head right in front of mine, and took 2 fingers or something and pinched my nose close so I would HAVE to respond to it and acknowledge it was there with physical movement.

I was in the middle of a dream and about to wake up so I wasn’t scared at all. But as I was gaining consciousness, the “demon” (or whatever it was) continued making these weird noises that kinda sounded like short whistles of the kettle. I honestly thought it was an actual person trying to wake me up because it didn’t have the conventional “ghost/demon” look/vibe to it. It seemed more like a prank/joke, as if it was just trying to tease/taunt me.

Sleepparalysis,"Sleep paralysis?

This just fucking happened in the front seat of my moms truck. I woke up to her telling me “I’ll be right back, are you gonna stay in here or come with me?” I don’t know if this was real, because the time I “woke” up I was in a paralyzed state

The thing is, I could still hear my music that was playing, my mom was next to me getting something and I could hear her laughing and squeezing my face as if she was taking a picture to tease me later about. I couldn’t see anything because my hat was on my face covering my eyes where I left it.

This one instance I was watching to this video on youtube and the youtuber sounded the same, exactly his style, everything felt right like I was awake. And then this song came on, the music that I could still hear. I was commenting about the song and then I blinked and something is already written for me. I blinked again and the comment was longer. Once I closed my eyes I was laying down, the hat on my face, and my hands trying to move.

And every time I tried to move, I was frozen again. The only thing I could move were my hands, I couldn’t even move my eyes.

The time I managed touch my mom, I could feel her skin, I could feel the heater. I just couldn’t move. I spent what felt like forever but was at least 5 minutes because I could still hear my music.

By the time I managed to touch her she didn’t do anything, I could feel her turn and nothing. My breathing started to get fanatic, it was getting louder and the only thing I could hear.

I woke up to looking at the backseat and nothing, it’s been 20 minutes since my mom got off.

It felt like forever but I was in that sleep like state for 20 minutes. I checked my spotify and the exact same songs I heard were there.

Here’s the thing, thorough out the whole thing I could see x rays of my eyes? I don’t know how to describe it, or if I moved my hat It would reset everything. If it didn’t reset anything then I would still see the hat, even if i moved it, it was still in the same place in my vision.",t2_ve7aa79z,0,Is this normal?,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,102mqhk,True,needhelpwithsleepTA,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/102mqhk/is_this_normal/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/102mqhk/is_this_normal/,53673.0,1672787527,0,,False,1672787538,1672787539,2023-01-03 23:12:07,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"So I've had sleep paralysis in the past every once in a blue moon, and it's horrible. Long story short it's getting worse and I've had three episodes in the past week. I know I'm asleep I can get my eyes to open but can't wake up or move. Example, I'll think I've thrown myself onto the floor in order to wake up when in reality I'm still dreaming.
I'll get my eyes to open and this struggle seems to go on for an eternity. I can't speak because a thought I had would be to send a text to my husband to call me through Siri but so far that's not an option.

Sleepparalysis,"I'll tell you mine! And it doesn't have to be sleep paralysis, the title is just being a little meanie so give it a bonk. c: I often get sleep paralysis, it has been a while but aye, PME caused me a lot of insomnia therefore more often sleep paralysis if that is the case.

Usually I get sleep paralysis waking up and during the morning so it's never a scary situation for me, but this time, I got sleep paralysis going to sleep. Okay, so I woke up in the middle of the night at two as always, and mind you that I tend to hear a lot of booming or whooshing sounds when I'm sleeping (exploding head syndrome), but this time I heard someone using a hair dryer. Now, because I was still moving and having my eyes open, I could assume it wasn't exploding head syndrome and my mind was fucking with me by dreaming consciously, unless that's pretty much what exploding head syndrome is, dreaming noises while being conscious- Which would make sense because it gave me the same reaction as to the usual booming or whooshing sounds, being scared but also annoyed and irritated by the noise that I was about to shout ""TURN IT OFF!!"" and wake up my family.   :')

Anyways, I had sleepwalking moments, such as waking up in the middle of getting ready to sleep, sitting around, waving my arms, which never happens to me so that's why I'm making this post. 😂 Although there was a time I ate so many of my new White Cheddar Cheez-Its, so many of them and I didn't get to enjoy them...   :') But yea, when I have sleep paralysis, the whole point is that my body is asleep while I'm concious, but it's the opposite with sleepwalking, you're asleep and unconcious while your body is doing its own shit, and nothing can fill in the gaps for you, only a whitness and some camera that I don't have at all, lmfao! So who knows what I did or what I said, but I'll give my body the benefit of the doubt that it was only having it's own fun in bed (s h u s h) instead of walking around, I've never had any experiences in heavy sleepwalking experiences that I know of.

This is where sleep paralysis begins. I was still spacing at my room, and at times I would feel stuck from moving that I would force move my body before fully getting sleep paralysis, and when I stopped moving for like- what felt like five seconds (in case it really wasn't five seconds), I couldn't move. Because I get sleep paralysis waking up during the morning, blinking usually wakes me up, but I think because the room was dark, that didn't help at all and I was frightening at the idea of hallucinating creepy shit because my main fear is encountering creepy things at night, and I don't mean sleep paralysis but sleep paralysis can make it a semi real nightmare for me. 🤠 Have I had sleep paralysis demons? Once, and it was cute. Do I hallucinate other things? Yes, people I know and sometimes strangers I've never seen before in my life, but I was determined to wake up.

So yea, blinking didn't work, and I tend to forget that I can wiggle my fingers so I didn't move them, but when I finally woke up, I felt my back sweaty cause NO SHIT!

Normally I can't move enough to break free but this time I knew I couldn't no matter how hard I tried. I need to be able to lift off the bed. It's always a struggle and a fight but even a blanket can hold me down so my arms pinned I was screwed.

I tried to talk but if anyone gets it like this all that I could do was inaudible or just too quiet. I made the loudest noise I could make, a whimper.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi, I've suffered with sleep paralysis for around 5 years.. I'm not sure if I really believe the paranormal reasons for it, however I am open to it after what I have experienced.. also the first time I got sleep paralysis, was after an ouija as I wanted to try and get through to something after loads of 'paranormal' things happened to me when I was a child, since then I get it weekly.

After having it for so many years, I've been able to sometimes control when I go into it and when I wake up.. a lot of times I am able to wake myself up, however I do fall asleep straight after again and it continues, also a lot of times I can't control any of it.

I haven't had sleep paralysis for around 2 weeks, I thought it was getting better up until yesterday when I had one of the most crazy and surreal experiences ive ever had.. I went to bed for a nap, wasn't really tired just being lazy and as I fall asleep I get the usual heavy feeling I experience before I'm about to go into sleep paralysis, a few moments later I realise I'm in sleep paralysis and unable to move, I then hear something in my room and a dark feeling comes over me and I'm aware the same thing that is always there when bad things is about to happen is in the room with me, I then start to feel tickling sensations on my ribs and stomach and it feels like torture.. if anything it feels in-between of being tickled and a painful feeling, however it always always feels 100% real. I manage to wake up properly and make a wedge next to my sides to see if it'll help, I then fall asleep again.

I try to go back to sleep and then I fall back into sleep paralysis, the thing is still in the room with me.. I then hear a scrambling at the end of my bed and I then feel it run up from the end of my bed up to my face, it then starts sniffing me and I'm scared.. recently my puppy died and I really thought it was my puppy as it was nibbling the same ear my puppy used to and i could feel fluff, but fear got the best of me and I assumed it was a rat and half woke up quickly, I then fell back asleep and it was still there... I was thinking to myself I just wanted to sleep so I thought in my mind/said I'm not scared of whatever is in the room with me and to fuck off, as I said that the sniffing dissappears and I then see a glimps of a shadow coming towards me and it goes behind my bed frame, I then hear clamping sounds and a shiny object that looks like pliers, it then picks my hand up and is threating to cut my fingers off 😦 all of the movements felt real and I could feel my fingers being individually selected and played with... I said the same thing and say im not scared, as I no longer have enough energy to wake myself up after doing it like 10 times, I was really scared though and could feel the fear all over my body 

As I say/think it, I feel vibration feelings in my legs and feet and my body gets dragged down my bed.. I manage to open my eyes a bit and I see a hole in my wall at the end of my bed and wardrobe like my wardrobe is a portal, I'm so scared and don't want to go through the hole but I'm being dragged and too deep in it to wake myself up.. 

When I'm in the hole, I open my eyes and I see darkness.. by this point it looks 80% real and I'm conscious, like how it would be if I was 100% awake, the darkness dissappears and I see myself being dragged into a tunnel and I kind of fall into a mining cart, I then look around and I'm in a mining tunnel and there's other creatures and people in the carts and lanterns everywhere, and other holes in the wall with others being dragged in.. keep in mind this all looks so realistic and I'm still aware I was just in sleep paralysis and have been dragged through a hole in the wall and I'm now in another world.. I literally thought I had died and was in the after life it was that real. As I'm in the mining cart I see a body and its dying, it says to me its soul was too weak and that this place is a test, after seeing that I jump/float out of the mining cart and I go through another hole in the wall to escape.. as a head I could see two pathways and I was afraid of having to go down one of them, I then kind of fall into another world (not too sure as it felt like floating whilst being in darkness) and then I open my eyes again and it looks really beautiful, but then I start getting chased by something saying I'm not supposed to be here and I wake up.. I'm assuming the fear woke me up and I was a bit hot and sweaty when I woke up

Sleepparalysis,"I slapped my sleep paralysis person and woke up has this every happened to anyone?

This just happened to me a few minutes ago I woke up at 4:40 ish. 

I was asleep dreaming and at some point I realized somethings wrong. Then I realized I was in this dream like state I was trying to escape out of my room and I was throwing myself off the bed ( but in my dream) my i was so heavy I couldnt fully move and and I wasn’t able to walk straight. I fell over sometimes. And while I made progress the dream would restart and I was back in bed screaming for someone to wake up me or to help me but again this was happening inthe dream. So no on could hear me. Other stuff happened but toward the end I was seeing a ceiling fan in my dream but I don’t realize it was a ceiling fan above my bed until i woke up woke up. It appeared twice as I trying to get my aunts room to get help. The first time I grabbed it and swung the light part of the fan  because it was in my way the second time it popped up right after the first one and I couldn’t swing or break it again I just pushed it aside but I remember thinking it was chipped but anyways that’s not the point.

Other stuff happened but the main point is that the dream restarted again. The last time is when I saw the person who just stay watching you during your paralysis. This my first time seeing them. Previously when I had sleep paralysis I hadn’t seen anybody but other stuff occurred in my other SP experiences. So when I saw the figure I gasped out fear and surprise. At some point,  in my dream I quickly approach figure And I insulted themI was like slap , back slap , “ what it is this your 9-5 job you just stand there being scary” slap slap and then I woke up gasping for air.

Of course when I finally managed to move on my own I saw nothing or no one. I’ve (22) been dealing with this since childhood but only twice in my life have I had the “demon” experience.

Sleepparalysis,"I've never experienced sleep paralysis before but I know people personally who have shared their experiences with me. And although, like I've said, I've never personally experienced it myself I did however believe it was a phenomena that happened to some people, just not me— well not me until recently.

Yesterday (Jan.2) I was cramming for my biochem test and reporting today (Jan.3), even though it got cancelled anyway because of the heavy rains so I'm pretty bitter about that because of what I unwittingly experienced.

You see I sleep in a room with my two younger siblings, we share a bunk bed and I sleep on the top bunk while they share the bottom bunk. I usually sleep on my side and yesterday I was doing just that while reading my notes on my phone— at some point I blanked out or maybe I fell unconscious because the next thing that I know is that I gain some clarity and that there was a pressure behind me, pinning me down from where I lay on my side atop the mattress of my bed.

Inwardly my first reaction was to freak out because wtf was happening? Afterwards I concluded that this was definitely not normal so I should definitely do something. So I struggled to move and attempted to lay on my back to maybe uno-reverse the thing keeping me still (to you know have me pinning it down instead of the other way around, idk why I thought to do that but that was my first choice of action).

Although I did think to do that I was unable to do so immediately for I couldn't quite move my body and I couldn't really see what was happening nor could I even feel the thing's touch, I only felt the pressure of something pinning me down. It was weird and my brain screamed that I might suffocate to death or smth along the lines from whatever the hell the thing was that pinned me down and left me numb— it was like someone was quite litterally hugging me from behind and keeping my limbs locked and unable to freely move. That does not comfort me at all, that honestly scared me more because did that mean this was gonna be a thing?

I continued to struggle until I felt my fingers again ans I realized I was clutching my phone this whole time— I thought to move my hand and slam said phone to whatever was behind me. I attempted to but there was litterally nothing pinning me down just the feeling of something doing so. This got me more freaked out so I did not stop struggling until I eventually I somehow managed to fully lay on my back but by then the pressure was gone and I felt like the world was reeling around me. Next thing I know I could sit up and move like whatever happened was just some silly dream I thought of.

I shakily opened my phone to look at the time it was 1:47AM, I sneaky took a glance at the reflection on my phone to see if I would be able to glimpse what was behind me but there really was nothing, I even built enough courage to check but once again nothing. I moved to look for my blanket and when I found it I immediately covered myself fully, then pulled my stuffed toys closer for comfort before I did the sign of the cross and started praying ""Our Father"" and ""Hail Mary"" for good measure (I'm a Roman Catholic so I automatically thought to pray to God, though it may be more of a habbit I do when I feel scared or after I watch something scary/creepy/unsettling). Then I messaged my younger siblings to see if they were awake (I was planning to ask one of them to sleep with me on the top bunk, okay I know I'm older than them sue me then because I felt super uneasy so I wanted emotional support🥹🥹) but they didn't send me a reply so I quickly took a peak at them from below and yes they were both peacefully fast asleep (lucky them I suppose 🥲🥲). Afterwards to keep my calm since literally no one was was awake and I was still freaking out I hastily searched of something on YouTube and played the 24/7 live rosary with my earphones on until I fell asleep again.

It was a weird experience and I feel super unsettled, I can't forget what happened nor can I find a proper explanation for it and I'm not even sure which Reddit I'm supposed to be posting this in but I assume it's sleep paralysis, right?

Sleepparalysis,"Hello! Thought I’d share my experience for anyone who cares and I’m also going through the sub to see any similarities. 

First off, I don’t remember the last time I had sleep paralysis or even lucid dreamt but when I was a child it happened all the time and I never knew what it was until I became an adult and thought back. When I was a child I was always scared to go to sleep, constant dreams of demons and monsters sitting on my chest and laughing at me or hiding all over my room. Use to think my house was haunted but it happened anywhere we moved too so I had no explanation. 

Last night was pretty fucking creepy though. I “ woke up” unable to move or speak. I thought I was awake but something seemed strange, I could see myself from 3D when I “wanted” to but I was also stuck in first person if that makes any sense. I could see a dark shadow see through silhouette of a human being hiding behind my door. I was stricken with fear , I closed my eyes at one point and this being was momentarily on my chest when I opened them but for the most part was staying behind my door. This being was lifting my limbs up and down and moving my blanket around too. Eventually I somehow regained control of my muscles but I was still unable to speak, I tried to yell at this being but only was able to yell with “ thought”. This being would respond in a super deep voice which was also “ thought” but I couldn’t understand wtf it was saying.

I heard my phone notification go off but despite this was still trapped in this “dream”. Eventually after I yelled stuff like “I’m not scared of you” or other slurs I snapped out of it and was laying in bed, I looked at my phone and sure enough had a snap 5 minutes prior. I was super sweaty and my heart rate was tachy as fuck. It felt REAL. 😂 

Shit was creepy, but I went back to sleep. This time it was very similar except it felt different. It felt more like a nightmare of the first “ dream”. I was able to move and speak and I actually lashed out at this “ being”, throwing pillows and my bedding at it and eventually woke up. I wasn’t sweaty or tachy and his time but I felt this sense of intense fear. Pherhaps just a nightmare, it did not feel as real as last time.

Sleepparalysis,"So last night I was having trouble sleeping, and I spent my time scrolling online then putting my phone down and tossing &amp; turning trying to go to sleep. While tossing &amp; turning I was thinking about the bad things I've been through, my childhood etc. I then went back on my phone ended up scrolling upon a bowl singing video. I ended up dosing off (im sleeping on my stomach btw) I then see a shadow and it was a female i automatically thought it was me so I flipped my head (not my body so I'm still on my stomach) as soon as I did that I couldn't move and I felt a pressure on the back of my  chest. I was scared yet curious I wanted to see what it was but I couldn't. My  first action I wanted to make once realized I couldn't move was to turn off that video I thought that it was caused it. Obviously I couldn't do that either. So then I got annoyed lol and call into a higher power, God or Universe. The pressure immediately left and I could move again and I went back to sleep. The strange part is I couldn't tell if it was me dreaming of having SP or dreaming of it and it happening simultaneously. I kinda felt like I was trying to escape a dream out of a dream but it was real if that makes sense. But I've felt that pressure before but without having SP so I don't know..as of now I'm not tired or anything I don't feel drained. I just turned 20 and I’ve never really experienced something like this or SP in general before idk if age has anything to do with it but I thought I’d mention it.

Sleepparalysis,"Here is my experience..

I was listening to a Joe rogan podcast with Graham Handcock as a guest around 3:30 am in bed. I closed my eyes and began to drift off to sleep while listening to the podcast play in the background. My bed is towards the corner of my room. One side of my bed touches one wall and the other side which is the headboard is against the window where my AC unit is attached. My door is clearly visible from my bed which I left slightly cracked for my cats to come in and out freely because they will cry/meow to come in the room if it's closed. Well I must have fallen asleep but in my dream I saw myself laying in my bed the surrounding sounds were exactly as if I was awake and I saw my door slowly start to open and a black entity was at the doorway then I felt myself being flung around the room as if my soul was being sucked or torn from my body. I tried to scream. I could couldn't move. Scream. Or even breathe. I felt myself struggle against this feeling and tried to call out my daughters name, whose bed Is next to mine where she was sleeping.  I struggled trying to wake myself up I felt this entity or force drag me over through my wall to my living room area and accend me up towards the ceiling where I stood for a few seconds wrestled with it mentally pleading to let me go until finally i was released or broke away and woke up. I woke up sweating, gasping for air and I tried to say my daughters name loudly to check on her but my fear turned my voice into a whisper. I looked over at my door it was wide open and I felt this presence slip away from the door. My mind was very hazy and I felt like I had actually been jarred around. That dizzy feeling you get when you spin around too fast..  my daughter is okay and didnt notice a thing shes still sleeping soundly. I have had these experiences before since I was a child but not for years. The thing is...I felt like there was a presence in my hallway at the back behind my door before I fell asleep just waiting or watching... and while I was getting comfy in bed I kept finding myself looking over expecting a cat to come in.. I'm actually terrified writing this because I don't do drugs or drink im 100 percent sober and I can't imagine what could of set this on. I wonder if it was my fear that onset this experience because I definitely was feeling something before I fell asleep. Sorry for sharing I just had to get it out.

Sleepparalysis,"So I get a lot of sleep paralysis or maybe I used to. I didn’t get any episodes of SP for over 3 months now. But the major episode happened with me around 6 months back where I met with the “cuddler”. And to be honest the moment I entered the SP, I recognised I was in one. A black fluid like figure was floating over me. It’s head came on my chest and just rested on it. So I saw it rested on me and everything and obviously I couldn’t move. The thing is I believe that demons do exist and I also think that Willpower plays a major role here. Because I basically started humping the black figure 😂 just to tell it that I am not afraid of you. Which made it go away easily after whispering something that I basically forgot. But after that I got about 5-6 episodes in the remaining 3 months. 

In all these episodes including the cuddler one, i started focusing more and more. Focused more on the surrounding and ecosystem around me. I just kept my calm. Focus basically helped me transcend back into the actual “reality“ maybe. From not moving an inch… to keeping the focus and being able to move again. I feel like focus and willpower is a big thing in SP. 

I know I have a lot of willpower, well actually my conscious has a lot of willpower I guess. I have got a lot of paranormal dreams where I have got so many paranormal beings… from burnt face ghost , to one looking like a hybrid of an owl and human. And in all of the dreams my conscious was able to defeat them, instead of being scared the shit out. Seriously, no kidding, in the dream I turned into a hulk… used some laser eyes like superman. Used the Iron Man armour. I bind the ghost with Spells like Dr. Strange. I know this sounds ridiculous but I am really proud of my conscious if that is a thing.

Sleepparalysis,I woke up in the middle of the night feeling really tired and relaxed and kinda realized how easy I could fall asleep again so I turned around and wanted to get back to sleep. I close my eyes and I can feel myself immediately fall asleep but I don’t truly fall asleep? I immediately can’t move. I can’t go “unconscious” the way you do when you fall asleep but I can’t wake up either. My brain then slowly starts to feel overwhelmed or something it’s a really weird and scary feeling. The overwhelmed feeling in my brain just gets worse and worse until it feels like it’s gonna explode and then I can finally force my eyes open but i’ll be so tired that my eyes just automatically close again and then the same things happens. It happened 4/5 times in a row and my legs feel weird now because of it.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi, I wanted to know what people’s worst SP experience was and share mine. It’s been 3 years and I’m still so disturbed from this- even with daily sleep paralysis for years, nothing has touched this.


This was back in 2019, I was 20. Since I had been around 16, I had gotten sleep paralysis nearly every time I fell asleep. Luckily I didn’t have hallucinations much, but it still sucked. However, that is what made this so scary because I wasn’t used to any hallucinations. 

I had went back to my dorm after class, and this was during the peak of people getting really sick from dab pens (I think because of additives). I had smoked a bit from my pen and went to nap because I was completely exhausted. I “woke up” to my door being slammed open and both my RA’s going, “is she breathing? I think she might have OD’ed or something. She looks blue and can’t move.” I was trying so hard to speak to tell them I’m okay. Suddenly I hear what i assumed was a doctor rush in the room and tell us there is an ambulance outside. I was so paralyzed trying to move. Btw my eyes were closed this was all auditory. 

Then I woke up. I was genuinely so disturbed I remember going home for the weekend. It felt so real. To this day I can’t explain it, and it stresses me out to think about it. It was legitimately my RA’s exact voices.",t2_4xzrzg0c,0,Worst hallucination/experience in SP?,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,100yqzn,True,bunnyqueens,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/100yqzn/worst_hallucinationexperience_in_sp/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/100yqzn/worst_hallucinationexperience_in_sp/,53627.0,1672620760,0,,False,1672620778,1672620779,2023-01-02 00:52:40,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"It's been about 3-4 years I can remember since having my first experience with sleep paralysis. For me, it's usually just not being able to move, realizing what's going on, trying to scream and thrash around, then eventually waking up.

However, in the past year or so the hallucinations have begun. I wouldn't call these ""nightmares"" due to how vivid they are. I actually feel myself moving and walking around, hearing things for real etc. I confirmed that it's not sleep walking or things actually happening though, because I share a bed with my girlfriend some nights and she has never noticed me actually getting out of bed or sleep walking.

Well early this morning (3 am) happened to be one of those nights she was over, thankfully. I usually get up at around 3 am for my job, so sometimes on the weekends it's a force of habit. So I got up and she was still asleep. I was on my phone for a bit but felt tired so went back to sleep. One of my triggers is going back to sleep after waking up already. 

So it begins. To best describe it, I know an episode is about to happen when I start to lose feeling in my body. Anyone else relate to me? 

Then I realize I can't move. Sometimes I have multiple short episodes but can usually regain my feeling. This time though, it went way farther than that.

Next thing I remember is me making a post on reddit on my phone and getting a lot of comments quickly (didn't happen). I felt paralyzed again afterwards. I felt like I woke up, then was talking to my girlfriend. She started laying on top of me, then I felt paralyzed again. Afterwards, the hallucinations started; my girlfriend snapped over to me unnaturally quickly like a movie or something and was whispering tounges or some other weird shit in my ear (didn't happen, nor did any conversations like I ""dreamt"" before I actually woke up for real). I continued to have random strange visions that felt very realistic; it was very vivid. Then I started to become lucid and self aware of the whole process, desperately fighting to get out of this absolute nightmare. Last thing that happened was me running to the bathroom in this vivid, lucid state to try splashing water on my face, and then I finally woke up for real.

I asked my girlfriend if we were talking at any point, and she said no, but she did hear me waking up panicked and gasping etc. She would not lie to me about something like this because she tells me I do other things like talk in my sleep and snore, besides I didn't disclose I had a SP episode, just asked if I was talking to her. 

I'm just freaked out by this and decided to join this subreddit and just write it out stream-of-consciousness like. I struggle with anxiety and PTSD which I feel has an influence on my SP. 

I hope I'm not alone out there.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello all.

I have had sp since I was a teen, probally 10 years or so, never had any hallucinations just darkness and no ability to move for a bit, it always happens when I'm falling asleep, never when I'm waking up. Not ideal but won't have to tell you guys that. Get up, take a sip of water, rinse and repeat before I fall asleep.

But since last week the sp has been accompanied by an intense, and I mean intense, physical pain. The first time it happened it felt like my head was caving in, starting with the ears, first came an intense ringing sound untill it felt like my head was going to explode. When I finally woke up I had the worst headache for 5 - 10 minutes, very strange but shrug it off.

For the last 2 days though, the discomfort is felt in my whole body, it feels like it starts in my arms / legs, as if they are asleep and spreads to my chest, making it feel like my heart / lungs want to explode while the same thing is happening in the head from the ears.

It's come to the point where for the first time in years sp is exhausting me again. I'm still very tired from working long hours before the holidays and at this point I'm just getting up if it happens again because it's downright painful and takes me about an hour to get settled again.

Now I'm wondering if anyone else on here has had similar experiences (hopefully in the past that went away after a few days 😄) and perhaps had any advice on how to deal with this.

Sleepparalysis,"Extreme Sleep Paralysis is not simply a bad dream or an hallucination, [It is VERY different.](https://electroballpage.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image-20151002-23105-h9ahcu-1.jpg)

During a research about ball lightning and natural ufos has been found a phenomenon responsible of many weird and paranormal events. [It is a ball of plasma with two layers with different electric charges](https://electroballpage.wordpress.com/383-2/). It use to be formed mainly at very high altitude or during storms, especially at night.

These balls can be invisible or look like balls of mist, shadows or like balls of light (orbs or ball lightning or even some ufos).  

If a person breathes air charged with electricity the blood will get the charge. This charged blood can attract these balls because they are charged too with the opposite charge thus colliding and compressing the person. If the ball is very energetic it could move or even [raise the person sleeping (levitation). If you breathe the external layer the attraction grows.](https://electroballpage.files.wordpress.com/2022/09/levitacion.jpg?w=1024)

This is the same mysterious [phenomenon that kills animals and mutilates](https://electroballpage.wordpress.com/animal-mutilations-by-proximity-to-electroballs/) them but with less energy. 

If it collides with your groin or lower belly the pressure would force it to enter like a rape!. (Yes, It is real!). Traditionaly they were called Incubi and Succubi.

These balls have such a strong electric field that they interfere with the nerves: paralysis and hallucinations are common. The attraction to the charged blood and the pessure could damage the skin with marks or even scars. The compression suffocates them too.

Sleepparalysis,"I have some questions for anyone else who experiences this…

For me it’s so distinct to know when it’s starting. With every breathe I can feel my body relax more, I get a high pitched “ringing” in my ears, more high pitched than regular tinnitus, and it feels like…. my brain is “rumbling”. These are the best words I can come up with to describe it but it is very distinct for me. 

My question is, what is this feeling? Something that’s even more weird is that my body goes through this same exact process sometimes while I’m awake? 

the “brain rumbling” specifically. It is a vibrating sensation that varies in intensity. It’s low for a few seconds, then it really cranks up, like someone smashing on a gas pedal, and then relaxes back to low intensity. and keeps repeating, in that sequence. It also has a noticeable “humming” to it. Again, this is the feeling I get before SP but it also happens when I’m just relaxing.

I’m going to be seeing a neurologist soon but I’m wondering why this happens while I’m fully awake not even trying to sleep.

Sleepparalysis,"Ok so I've been experiencing sleep paralysis since I'm like 12 and I took a while to understand what was happening. Eventually I figured it was sleep paralysis, went to Google it of course and it said it was harmless so I let it be no matter how bad it was.
Recently I has more curious about my hallucinations and maybe they aren't as normal as I thought so I was wondering if I should be concerned or not.
First in the spam of approximately 8 years I experienced really a lot of sleep paralysis, sometimes 2 to 3 times a week other times nothing for months, that apparently isn't really normal either.
I always have visual hallucinations, most times are the normal kind, a black or white figure just there doing nothing and some really loud noise. But other times is really specific, the first time ever it was a really big and skinny clown coming out of my closet while my room was spinning really fast, he has also laughing and clapping I still can remember everything about him, even the colors of the clothes. Other times is my cat behaving really weird like it's neck just starting to grow or him attacking me but not really being there. There was a time when my housemates just entered my room with a black figure but they were all deformed, and they were making fun of me and stuff like that.
The ones that made me question if it was normal was one time I was sideways and something just started to slowly perforating my skin like sharp claws I started to cry because of the pain. And other I started to feel a hand touching my legs but that one stoped quickly.

Sleepparalysis,"Before we start I must clear that I sleep with my back up and not chest.

So few days ago I had a weird experience at night. I was awake whole night and was only able to sleep at 4AM, I woke up about an hour again after I had a weird dream. I felt like my righr leg was stuck in blanket (spoiler: it wasn't, it was also a hallucination) so I tried removing it but I couldn't move it and before I move my body I saw a 4 feet tall figure was standing few feet away from my bed. Only way to express it is 'humanoid pile of clothes', I don't remember it having any facial features but I was certain it was looking at me. 

After some time it disappeared and I felt weight on my back like someone was sitting one but it wasn't too heavy. Grip of blanket on my ankles was also getting tighter. My first response was to slap whatever it is (that's how I deal with fear) that was the time I realized  that I couldn't move. I suddenly started screaming, it gave loud and strange screech, it was supernatural and unhuman voice, it wasn't too high pitch. It was just  strange and it lasted very long, like atleast a minute. Voice started fading away after some time and I was able to move my body and my leg came back to normal.

Reason to post it here is from all of the accounts I've heard or read, the SP demon always sits on chest; but in my case it was sitting on my back. I also don't remember having difficulty to breath.

He experienced a very strange sleep paralysis about a month ago. He told me about the experience of it just a day ago because I was kinda on a break.

When he started telling me about the experience it didn't took me long to figure out that something was wrong. Firstly he said that there was a woman sitting on his chest which is okay till some extent because hallucinations do occur, but here is the catch, he started to describe the woman. Of course the  woman was looking terrifying but the way he described it was too vivid of a hallucination to occur in sleep paralysis. He could even see her face and her eyes. He describes her skin to be pale, burnt, and blistered.  I mean, I have only saw dark figures and everyone I have asked about there experience whether on internet or in real life has too see dark figures ONLY. Then he describes that he feeling weight on his chest but that is kinda normal. He also felt sensations on his body which is also okay.

But then he told me how he got out of it. And here is the part that is crazy. He told me that after being in the same position for pretty long he felt like someone pierced a needle at the tip of his middle finger. It is when he snapped out of it. Now when he saw his finger there was actually blood there.

I respect other perspectives about this, because sometimes I do wonder if there is something else.

I want to tell what happened to me just to take it out of my mind, and because I wonder if someone went through something similar.  One day I was taking a nap, my room was dark, but there was a window on front of me, with a bright white light.

I remember that I saw how a huge golden light came inside the room through the window and it grab me, I levitated to the ceiling and I received the most powerful golden light inside my chest. It felt that I was looking directly at God, nothing human like, just light, warmth, peace, joy, and love, so much love. I breathed to take everything in, knowing that this experience was the most important of my life. A brighter white light was on my face, like those theater lights, and the golden one was on my chest. I felt tiny, my body was hanging in the middle of this universe of pure divine energy.

I'm not religious, but I was in ecstasy and aware of a divine presence.

 Suddenly something grabbed me from behind and pulled me down back to the bed, and I recognized the signs of a normal sleep paralysis. It went from light to dark. I couldn't scream or move, and it took me against the mattress and raped me. I felt everything, and I was in so much pain. I waited until this thing finished, without even trying to move because I was terrified, and when it stopped I feel relieved, but somehow the thing noticed that, and it raped me again. 

When I was able to move I couldn't stop crying. I know that this it's not truth, I know that it's a sleep paralysis, but how on earth can this whole scenario be so, so disgusting and horrifying? I feel punished for experiencing something amazing, and this (masculine being) knew it.

Lately I've been having what seems to be sleep paralysis. It's random when it occurs but started when I was taking a medicine I was prescribed for migraines. 

It started slowly, I would have very strange, disturbing dreams and I would wake up with sores from scratching myself in my sleep. That progressed to me being awake but not awake and unable to move, seeing a creepy girl lying next to me and holding me down.

I stopped taking the prescription (it was to be taken on an 'as needed' basis) and switched to Excedrin, thinking the prescription caused it but it still occurred.

Last night was the worst, I was awake but not awake. My body felt heavy and I couldn't open my eyes, I couldn't move my arms or legs but I could feel some dark slimy creature pressing my head down into the pillows. This went on for awhile, I would try to force my arms to move, try to get up and pull myself out of it, only to move one arm slightly and fall back into the trap of being asleep but still conscious and unable to move.",t2_44pc2z80,0,Am I having sleep paralysis?,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,zyry3a,True,RogueKhajit,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zyry3a/am_i_having_sleep_paralysis/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zyry3a/am_i_having_sleep_paralysis/,53593.0,1672377618,0,,False,1672377630,1672377631,2022-12-30 05:20:18,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"I am sorry to ask this - normally I would ask elsewhere but I can't find anything on it. It feels wrong to ask because I think my experience was not SP and instead some sort of other hallucination - otherwise its not really explainable.   


I was relaxing on my side and saw a thing. I'm not going to go into details because I don't want to make a ghost post. I saw a humanoid figure and I \*immediately\* sat up and said: ""hello.... who are you?""   


I don't easily get scared of things that could harm me (instead other things scare me lol but not this sort of stuff). I think that is why I was so chill. At first, anyway. I've posted my full story elsewhere and been told it was likely sleep paralysis but I had never experienced the feeling of being unable to move and I certainly didn't feel that way that time either. This happened about 2 years ago. 

Just this week, I had a strange wakeup experience where I heard super loud noises that I already knew probably weren't real and I also felt like I was vibrating in a rhythm. weirdest thing ever. It was like a mobile ringtone on silent. I \*was\* the phone, though. Not just like it was inside me, nah my \*entire\* body was doing the VRRRT VRRRRT VRRRRT of a silent phone call. Pretty wild. It was sort of just astonishing and therefore a little scary, made me wary to go back to sleep and I stayed up researching a little after. Found exploding head syndrome (such a cool name) and I feel that explained the noise perfectly! But the vibrations I don't know. Also the paralysis --- the key point in question --- because of the auditory hallucination and because I was pretty sure at the time that the noise wasn't real (confirmed via sleep recording after), I just thought I wouldn't be able to move naturally due to still being half asleep. So I didn't try to move much, to my memory. Its hard to say because things are so foggy in that half awake/half asleep state. Not at ALL like the humanoid figure experience. THAT I remember vividly like any normal memory. strangeness.

Sleepparalysis,"I’m 28 years old and have been having sleep paralysis 4-5 times a week for as long as I can remember. Until I was about 16 or so I thought it was normal and everyone experienced it. I just thought that I dreamed about being in my bedroom at the start of every dream. I very often had the terrifying hallucinations that everyone sees but the majority of the time I wasn’t bothered or I would reason with my self and say “if I just sleep through this bad part of the dream, I won’t have to wake myself up and fall asleep again.” Because of that self awareness of sleeping I also was consistently lucid dreaming and was doing this without trying and thought everyone’s dreams were this vivid every night. The hallucinations weren’t always scary things either and were actually really pleasant. For a very long time I saw my family dog that had past away was laying on the foot of my bed almost every night just sleeping.

When I finally realized what was happening and that it was not normal I did more research on sleep disorders and eventually was told by my parents I had horrible night terrors as a kid and would consistently sleepwalk acting out my dreams but grew out of it by the age of 7 or so. I also learned my grandpa that had passed away had those as a child too and in to his adult life was a big sleep talker and had sleep paralysis too up until his death. I always saw it as a connection to him in a way.

About six months ago they stopped all together and I don’t know how I feel about it. The lucid dreaming stopped as well. Sleeping used to be an exciting fun thing, but since all this has stopped I have no motivation to sleep other needing to to survive. I’ll find myself on my phone until 3 am every night and only go to sleep out of extreme exhaustion from only getting 4 hours the night before.

It started out with a back massage. It really caught my attention and I immediately knew I was in the state of SP. I have had massages before and they often feel good and soothing. This time it had a more aggressive angry energy. 

Next I danced around in a circle. Last year I had something similar but it felt nice and I felt the presence of some type of fairy or princess dancing with me. This type it was faster and felt ritualistic. I looked this up and couldn't find anything about dancing in circles during SP, I must be the only one.

Basically I fell asleep during my study break. And the next thing I knew I was dreaming. The dream was so weird there were elevators, my father and extended family was there, there weird animals in a big and long parking lot chasing each other. And this parking lot is like under a very huge rush ppl hotel+bidding area. This parking lot was also under constructions so there were like holes on the ground.

I remember this part where I was going up the elevator with my dad. I got out and so did he is what I assumed and then the next thing is to get on the escalator but I couldn’t spot my dad and I was ald on the escalator. All this is happening while consciously I could feel my heartbeat increasing, my eyes getting heavier and my head is starting to hurt. This feeling like I was high (ps I have never been high b4, but this is what I assume it feels like). So I tried waking up like tried moving my body but I couldn’t so I continued dreaming where I ran to the elevator but my dad was not that and instantly I tot oh he abandoned because I acted crazy back at home earlier (this is the dream storyline). And that is when the running started I ran in this parking lot to get out of that place. As I was running there were animals like chicken, cats, horses, featherless birds and normal birds, I think there might have been flamingos too. The run felt forever. And each second that passed my head started to hurt more and more, my eyes getting heavier and my breathing was slightly faster but my heart was definitely racing. When I reached the sunlight which means I was out the parking lot, I woke up as in my body woke up. My brain have been awake for that whole shit show.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve only told this to my mom and boyfriend who don’t take dreams or anything seriously. A few years ago I was having sleep paralysis once every few weeks. It started after I turned my bed to face another direction? I’m not sure why. But one experience still freaks me out to this day. 
I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night on my back. I felt very tired but when I went to check the time I realized I couldn’t move. 
Then, very slowly, I felt the blankets slowly being lifted off of my right foot to expose it. I started breathing heavily trying to wake up. 
I then felt what I can only describe as “darkness” start pulling me by the foot under my bed. I was absolutely terrified. 
I could see my leg slowly being pulled off the bed as if someone was underneath trying to pull me out. 
I literally felt and saw my leg fall off the side and I could see and feel the “darkness” pulling harder to get me to fall off the bed. 
It made me panic so hard that I was able to finally burst out and move again.

Sleepparalysis,"Last year around this time (early December) I went to watch/support my boyfriends cheer team at a competition in Wisconsin. This hotel was right across from the great wolf lodge where the competition is held at. I drove up late Saturday night after work and slept there with him that night. In the morning (around 6:30) he left to go coach and get his teams warmed up while letting me sleep a couple more hours. He gave me a kiss and told me to tell him when I wake up. I rolled over back onto my stomach hands tucked under the pillow with my head tilted slightly.

I fell back to sleep and shortly after was awoken suddenly with a heavy weight of something on my back. I heard heavy breathing in my right ear with my face down into the pillow. This was not normal breathing. This was the sound a horse/bull makes from its nose (idk what it’s called). I could FEEL the breathes. I felt something under my left hand and when I squeezed my hand shut I realized it was a thumb. I tried to push myself upwards but I couldn’t. I was stunned in fear.

The only pictures flashing through my mind were that of a Minotaur or demon like figure. I kept counting down in my head to ready myself to push as hard as possible and run. 3..2…1.. nothing. I couldn’t move the breathing and weight increased. I finally got the courage and strength to finally push myself up and immediately out of the bed. I stood by the wall opposite of the bed staring at it tears rolling down my face. Nothing was in the room. But I knew what I just experienced was real

Sleepparalysis,"I’m from South Korea where sleep paralysis is an extremely common experience for everyone. Even if one never experienced it, they still know what it is. I learned the word “sleep paralysis” for the first time at age 7 or so. All kids knew what it is even though they didn’t experience it yet. Koreans usually say they see “ghosts” when it happens.

I experienced my first sleep paralysis when I was 12, and it’s around that age for other Korean friends too if they’ve ever experienced it. I didn’t hallucinate yet though. Some friends said they already saw “ghosts” in their sleep paralysis when they were a kid.

Later, I moved to Europe and lived in a couple of European countries. I experienced sleep paralysis extremely frequently that time that at some point it was an everyday thing. I also started hallucinating in my sleep paralysis sometimes. I saw absolutely creepy stuff and it was so vivid and real that it made me believe in ghosts for the time being.

I told my European friends about my awful sleep paralysis experience, and realised that most of them didn’t even know what it was. They’ve never experienced it, and never even heard of it. I’ve talked to at least 20 European friends from different countries, and only one of them knew what it was before I explained it. He said he frequently experiences it too, and he usually hallucinates a man standing in his room. 

I’m wondering why it is such a common knowledge in Korea but not in Europe. It seems like Koreans definitely experience it much more often than Europeans. Could it be a cultural influence? What is it like in your country or culture?",t2_v9icj30h,0,Is there a cultural difference in the frequency of experiencing sleep paralysis?,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,zxg2oh,True,Lasciachiopianga,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zxg2oh/is_there_a_cultural_difference_in_the_frequency/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zxg2oh/is_there_a_cultural_difference_in_the_frequency/,53565.0,1672250069,0,,False,1672250086,1672250087,2022-12-28 17:54:29,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"For context: I don’t know if this is relevant but I have lupus and a few other mental illnesses. Nothing has ever happened like this before. 

Last night, I had a dream where I knew it was a dream and that I was sleeping. In the dream, I was sleeping in bed next to my boyfriend. (Which is what I was doing in real life). Only difference is, in my dream, my dog was sleeping on her bed next to our bed. She sleeps in her crate in the dog room. (She loves her crate, I try to get her to sleep with us but she doesn’t). This will make more sense later. I roll on my back in real life and in my dream

I suddenly wake up in the dream and I start breathing like I’m panting. It’s the same type of breathing you get during a panic attack. It felt like I couldn’t get enough air. I try to wake my boyfriend up in my dream so he can help me. I try calling his name but I can’t talk at all. I try moving my arm to poke him but I can’t move. I’m just stuck, struggling to breath. 

For some reason, in my dream he just miraculously wakes up. He looks at me and says “I don’t feel so good”. I wanted to respond that I didn’t either. My dog starts barking really loud and intense at something. I still can’t move or talk to see what it is. But I didn’t need to, this dark figure, almost cloud like, floats over our heads. It just stays over our heads and I remember being terrified. 

I suddenly am able to remember it’s a dream and somehow wake up. I yelled “me too” as I was waking up. My boyfriend woke up and comforted me. After I called down he asked me why I screamed “me too”. I told him I was responding to him telling me he doesn’t feel good in my dream. I was somehow able to fall back asleep. 

I have never had anything remotely like this before and it was absolutely terrifying. My boyfriend doesn’t think this was sleep paralysis but on the research I’ve done, it seems like it is to me. The best way to get a good answer is Reddit lol.

Sleepparalysis,"
Yeah sorry for this long thing I just like writing about things that pop up in my head. Btw I’m not asking for help or support btw so don’t feel obligated to comment anything! im just writing just to write cause I can :D

Anyways, ive been having sleep paralysis since i was 11 (im 13 now) and I’ve never necessarily have had a problem with it like how a lot of people do. i don’t get scary hallucinations or even hallucinations in general, i don’t feel scared, nothing. yeah sometimes I hear noises but I’m always aware that it’s not real so it doesn’t freak me out. rather than it being scary or being a problem for me, it’s quite painful for me to be in SP.

how do i describe the feeling… it’s kinda like a vibrating sensation under my skin? like a spikey, pins and needle feeling under my skin. I’d say the best way for me to describe it is when your leg falls asleep when you’re sitting down, then standing up and it’s painfully numb rather than just numb… but it’s your entire body that’s painfully numb. it’s not some terrible excruciating-FUCK FUCK FUCK THIS HURTS SO BAD HELP ME-kind of pain, it’s more of just a really really really uncomfortable feeling. 

there’s also a very irritating ringing in my left ear which is annoying because I’ve fully lost my hearing on that ear, not very fun that the thing i can hear on my left ear is a loud ringing. ive also experienced voices of children(??) screaming repeating words or something like that, but i don’t remember it being anything scary or bothersome. 

I don’t get scared if I hear noises while in SP because I can automatically know im in SP when I feel that awful vibrating spiky needle-ish feeling under my skin, especially on my neck! it hurts the most on my neck, it feels like my veins are the ones that are spiky. so yeah when I’m in SP I could care less about wtf im hearing or seeing, all im thinking about is how painful it is and how i wanna get out.

im always just thinking “whatever i hear or see isn’t real, this is only temporary paralysis so don’t freak out” and it’s been working for me since I was 11. (No, this is not me giving stupid advice because I know that other people experience SP differently, im just voicing my thoughts.)

Idk i feel bad for talking all casually about it when people genuinely go through the most fucked up shit while in SP but yeah. It just really hurts but once I get out of SP im completely fine. don’t really enjoy waking up everyday with my neck feeling likes there’s needles under my skin",t2_dhmd5vag,0,just random thoughts about my SP,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,zx6bw7,True,keyuiji,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zx6bw7/just_random_thoughts_about_my_sp/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zx6bw7/just_random_thoughts_about_my_sp/,53557.0,1672223348,0,,False,1672223363,1672223363,2022-12-28 10:29:08,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"Hey! Lately, I've noticed that I've been experiencing a bit more sleep paralysis episodes. I have grown up with sleep paralysis since I was 13 years old. When I experienced them already as a youngster, it was just as dangerous but not an alarming experience. That is, I have always somehow known that my sleep paralysis episodes are nothing but pure fantasy even as a young child.

My episodes have always stuck to a contrast where I see shadows and feel a kind of full feeling where there is something holding me in place that makes me unable to move. I always hear my eardrum beating louder which gives a bit of a temporary headache during the episode I'm going through. But after a while I manage to move my fingertips which eventually causes my whole body to come to life which causes my episode to end. During the whole process I am fully conscious but my body is motionless. This is how I have experienced my episodes through all my years.

But now in 2022, I have experienced that the episodes have gotten a little bit worse... It went from a little headache and a simple episode to hearing big rushes and steps from, for example, my kitchen towards my bed. I will try to describe how my episode is as precisely as possible.

Today when I went to bed I was half asleep, and I noticed that all of a sudden I was in an episode. But that knowledge was quickly forgotten because I started hearing rushing steps from my kitchen, which is on the same level as my bedroom. The footsteps stopped right next to my bed as I lay with my head against my wall. I don't know if I did this myself or if it was already like that, but it felt like the covers fell off my head, and my own hair on the back of my neck stood up. Then I started hearing whispers against my neck from what sounded like a female voice. The words she whispered against my neck were incomprehensible and I understood absolutely nothing she said but I could feel her breath on me even if I couldn't smell it.

The episode didn't last long and I managed to get movement in my fingertips again which made my body come alive. But this is how my episodes have been lately just when my sleep paralysis has occurred. Is anyone experiencing the same things and how do I work on these episodes more than I am already trying to do and why have they gotten worse?.

Sleepparalysis,"I had a small episode in which I woke up to see someone staring at me from my desk chair. Classic sleep paralysis and I managed to go back to sleep after.

Woke up to find my pillow in the hall and I'm pretty sure I don't sleepwalk (never mind through a door and with a pillow). Also, door was closed, pillow on the ground in front of the mirror.

Kinda creeped me out. I know that logically, I probably put it there (I live alone, door is locked) but I've never done that before. Throwing it over the edge of the bed? Sure. Walking through a closed door and near the outside door? Nope.

Sleepparalysis,"Okay, around two/three years ago I had a SP episode that I find rather odd. Before you read this, I have learned by lesson on sleep deprivation and will never let myself do this. 

It's probably 4 AM. I've stayed up all night, and my mind and body both want to give up. I'm watching a documentary on Earth and it's history. I'm listening to this documentary for half an hour. I end up passing out. I suddenly wake up, I'm unable to sit up. My body aches. I can move my arms, feet, ect. However, this is extremely difficult. I work as hard as I can to sit up. Using all of my energy that barely exists anymore. I finally sit up. The relief sweeps through my entire body. This relief relaxes me enough to fall backward and pass out. The moment I fall back, I am out into a dream where I'm in a state of awareness. This sheer panic wakes me up. I'm unable to move. My body is nearly paralyzed entirely. My fingers can't move. My arms barely respond. My legs and feet seem alienated. My chest is immobile except for the slow breathing that I can't control. I can't even speak. The struggle tires me out as I fall back into a dream. I can see again. I can feel my blankets smothering me with comfort. My pillows don't look like pillows anymore. I see a box and papers. I see a shattered TV where my normal TV is. Through the changing cracked screen, I can see that YouTube auto played the next video. My room seems to shift and change. I feel scared, but I don't worry. I sit there, content and accepting with the universe. And then, I fall asleep for the last time.

This is why I don't like sleep deprivation. Never EVER let this happen to you. Anyways, any similar stories? Movement in your SP? Wacky hallucinations?

Sleepparalysis,"Had sleep paralysis last night. Happens all the time but not for a while. 

All my sleep paralysis starts with me 'waking up' in my bed, so it always is scary at first until I figure out I'm still sleeping. 

I 'woke up' and couldn't move and just felt the general terrified feeling of the sleep paralysis. Was looking at my husband next to me and I started screaming out his name. No sound was coming out and couldn't move. This went on for a bit and I was thinking if I screamed for him enough he might hear me and wake me up in real life. I could eventually do a little roll towards him, and when I rolled he kind of slipped off the bed and disappeared completely. I fell off the bed onto the floor and there was a figure who started coming towards me. 

The figure was a scribble man. It looked like if you did a scribble on paper with black pen. The scribble was darker where its face would have been, and the scribble was moving and changing as he slowly crept towards me. 

Then was very happy to actually wake up!",t2_fcxm4kd9,0,Scribble Man,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,zwvgpm,True,rkbgray,,0,True,,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zwvgpm/scribble_man/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zwvgpm/scribble_man/,53544.0,1672188121,0,,False,1672188132,1672188132,2022-12-28 00:42:01,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"Guys. I just had a horrible sleep paralysis episode about 40 minutes ago. But this time it was different and similar to other stories at the same time. I even got out of bed and walked dow the stair in my SP “dream”. But what was even worse, it that I started hearing the loud crying of a baby (it seemed like a 4-5 year old toddler) coming from the bathroom. It was horrifying, as it was also shouting “the cream, the cream” (but in spanish, as I live in Mexico). I have even more stuff to add. I stood up in the first loop and when to see what was coming from the bathroom. I wasn’t even scared the first time. I walked up to it looked inside and saw the figure of a toddler get up from the shower and start walking towards me. I closed the door, slamming it two times as the first time the door didn’t lock. I walked fast down the stairs to get to my grandmother sleeping downstairs (it seemed like a defense mechanism as I always found confort from my mother figures. But it wouldn’t have helped much against a toddler demon in the bathroom). But all of a sudden I was paralyzed in the middle of the stairs. It felt like glitching inside an FPS video game. And as quick as that, I was back in the bed, hearing the cries. I saw a figure starting to materialize in front of the bathroom door (I will leave a photo of the view so you realize what it kind of looked like). I wanted to shout so loud, but I couldn’t as you it often happens. I tried my hardest to shout, and then I tried to shout my grandmother’s name. I tried three-four times and the last time I woke up screaming her name. Literally with the same view in front of me, stood to a sit from the bed and tried to calm down. I had never had such a presence in a SP episode, I rarely hallucinate or have “nightmares” during one. It felt like a loop. I found out after some research that some people have also had babies in SP dreams, hallucinations and apparitions. It was horrible and I remember it vividly. What was even worse is that I woke up just in tu me for online work &gt;_&lt;. I swore to the SP demon I would destroy it and drain it’s energy. Maybe it will never happen again. Or it will suffer for all eternity, I swear.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi, writing this as I have just woken up two times in one night now from this.

Whenever I am stressed or am changing my sleep pattern, I will have a bad or weird dream(?). I say this because I am unsure if my eyes are open or not during this. Sometimes it is me in my room, in the exact position I fell asleep in, laying in my bed. I will be unable to move, and weird things will start happening.. nothing really scary but just weird things, like a man laying in bed next to me. Or I'll start floating into the air. But sometimes it is just a regular nightmare or uncomfortable dream, not in my room where I fell asleep. 

But I always have to wake myself up by trying to move my limbs?? It feels like I am submerged in thick mollases, and it takes me a good minute of trying to fight to move my limbs and wake myself up. Is this sleep paralysis or just something different??? I am unsure if it is..

Also my dad struggled deeply with sleep paralysis and I am unsure if it is genetic or not.

I feel this is also relevant. One time, after fighting myself awake by moving my limbs, I woke up and immediately sat up, and hallucinated a whole vacuum cleaner (???) in my room, until I fully woke up and the hallucination went away. This really freaked me out tho, lol. I don't often hallucinate otherwise.

Sleepparalysis,"As of recently starting like about a week I have been having more s’more episodes of sleep paralysis. I will do my best to explain it 

So when I begin to go to sleep mode I quickly feel a strong presence pulling me down or towards the side and right away I know something is wrong so it becomes a power struggle with what ever it is and mean luckily for me I always end up winning and wake up. So this had happened already for 4 nights and this was the 4th night. I told myself that if I had the encounter again I would challenge it and so I did. Right off the bat I felt what ever it was pulling me down and towards the corner but he was pulling like all of my shoulder and right side of my face towards the right bottoms corner and down. The first thing I did was trying to figure out where this motherfucker is at. He was at the top right corner of my vision and it might sound weird but if I struggle back and forth I can wake up but the struggle I had this time around wasn’t to wake up it was more of a struggle to beat this shit. I’ve always believed you can’t show fear so I divided to stay in the dream and fight this thing. Next thing you know from it pulling and me pulling we were flying and spinning down in circles and the speed was increasing. Next thing you know I woke up and I knew it wasn’t because of me I’m quite confident I whooped this things ass in that one. This struggle is different from the struggle of me wanting to get wake up. Anyways I decided to watch some one piece for a while just because after the incident I couldn’t fall asleep not because of fear but more of frustration because man I’m trying to go to sleep lol. Anyways I fell asleep sideways hugging a pillow unlike the original sleeping position which is in my back. Next thing you know I am having another episode of sleep paralysis and this time I see like a dog like face looking at me I thought it was my dog because it’s fur was dark like my dog soon enough I realized that wasn’t my dog not because of the features but because I couldn’t move or talk. The dogs eyes were glowing but it wasn’t a bright glow just a small minor one to tell the difference anyways I tried to call it thinking it was my dog then I realized it wasn’t and tried to grab it but couldn’t my hand barely moved but it moved which makes me glad because it felt impossible to move I called it a bitch and woke up

Usually always starts with ringing or white noise as i can feel my body becoming paralysed.  Then i start spinning in the bed.  I can feel my skin rubbing against the bedding as im being spun.

This is nearly always followed by visions of shadow men or possessed people in the room talking to me with demonic looks on their faces.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello. I have been experiencing SP for more than 10 years (I am currently 26). It usually happens when I try to wake up from a nap, or before I even I fall asleep. The weird thing is that it never happens at night, only during a daytime nap.I get a buzzing noise and vibration in my whole body. The more I try to move, the more intense the noise and vibrations. When I manage to relax enough, I can finally open my eyes and move.

I heard many times people saying that they had a really vivid dream, however I am afraid to tell people that sometimes I can control my dreams, or that I know that I am in a dream and nothing is real. It happened many times that I had SP, and then I thought that I woke up and did some things, but I actually was still in the SP. Very confusing. It also happens that I can actually control a dream, because I know that I am in a dream. I also have the impression that I saw the same dream more than once, or the same places/people/occasion more than once. But of course I am not sure as it might be a trick of my brain again. 

I am so happy that I found people with the same experiences as me, as I live in a small island (a very close society) and I can not really say anything. Most probably they will think I am crazy or taking anything.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve had a reoccurring paralysis I think that has been happening basically once every two weeks or so. It’s terrifying and almost always the same. here’s a example of one, I open my eyes, I just went to bed not to long ago ,but it almost always happens right after I fall asleep.

Sleepparalysis,"so I have always been curious as to what is happening to me, I’ve tried to explain it to people but it’s nearly impossible to explain and no one ever understands it they just say that it’s probably sleep paralysis. I will try my best to explain this to you and maybe someone can relate or knows what it could be. So it starts off with me being very tired and laying down to go to sleep, and how I know that it’s about to happen is I feel very tired and then feel this weird tingly feeling in my nose and face and rarely when I feel the tingling I can try to jolt myself awake and it works every now and then but almost everytime when I feel the tingle I have already fallen asleep and it’s to late. So once I’m asleep all I see is black but I am fully conscious and aware of what’s happening basically like I am awake but can’t move and eyes sealed shut. So what happens next varies by a lot of different things, but I’ll stick with what has a been happening recently. So it starts with me not being able to take a breath no matter what I can’t breath and it feels like I am suffocating in really life and every single time it waits until I feel like I’m about to die for me to be able to breath again, then I gasp for air and that’s when stage 2 starts. From here it also varies what can happen like last night I got very lucky and after I got my breath back I was able to jolt myself awake before stage 2 happened. But this is usually not the case, so stage 2 usually starts with me being thrown around my room or being dragged off my bed by something or I will hear one of my family members walk in my room and I’ll try to tell them to wake me up but I can never talk it feels like my lips are sealed together but it’s almost always something different but the most common one is I’ll be thrown around my room and it will feel like I’m falling from the sky in my stomach and after that a lot of the time it will end and I’ll be thrown back to my bed and I’ll wake up but if I don’t that’s when stage 3 happens. Stage 3 is usually the most terrifying that’s when my mind really knows how to scare me s3 can consist  of so many things like for example one time I got drug off my bed and hit my head on my bed table and could feel it breathing and it made me think I died and j can hear my family come in my room a d talk to me asking me if I’m okay and sometimes I can open my eyes a little bit and see them but it’s very blurry. Also wanted to say that as soon as stage 1 starts I start to hear like family guy or my tv or people talking and i always think that I left my tv on but when I wake up it’s always off so idk why but I just wanted to make that noted that I always hear stuff. But anywase only thing I can do now is give examples to help you get the picture. Also about me saying my eyes feel like they are sealed shut earlier they don’t actually feel that way but for some reason the first time I every had one of these dreams when I was probably like 10 I opened my eyes and I guess I saw something that terrified me because I have never brought my self to opening my eyes I’m always so scared to and that gives me the chills writing that because I don’t remember what I saw but it obviously scared me to badly that I know not to open them. Also I can move as well and idk if I move in real life or not but I’m as well very scared to move for some reason. Anywase I have a lot of examples that happened so long ago these are ones that really freaked me out. I fell asleep and at stage 3 I was laying there and I “heard” my sister and her bf walk in my room whispering they were trying to prank me, I hear them sneaking up to me and I wanted to wake up and tell them that knew they were trying to scare/prank me but ofc I couldn’t. I thought that this was all really happening in real life btw but it wasn’t it was just the stage 3. Anywase once they finally snuck up to my bed i was still trying to wake up and I headed them say “oh my god he has a huge gash of his head” and I could feel my sister touch the “gash” on my head and that’s when I thought I was dead and then they started crying saying I was dead and alls I wanted to do was wake up and tell them I was alive but finally I woke up irl and walked in there room they were just laying on bed watch movie. So yeah my mind or whatever this shit is knows how to fuck with my really badly that one was pretty traumatic.

Sleepparalysis,"This has been bothering me for a while. Bear with me, this might be a bit long. 


I’ve been having sleep paralysis for as long as I remember. It’s just something I got used to eventually.


But it’s getting weird lately. I get stuck in these loops where I am dreaming. In this dream, I’m in my bed but it doesn’t feel right. It doesn’t feel real. It feels like an alternate reality. In this dream I realize that I am in sleep paralysis and I try to do the usual things I do to try and wake up; try to move my finger or wiggle my toes. After a lot of strain, I do wake up and I move about until I realize this isn’t the real world; it’s still a dream. Then I’m in bed again, trying to wake. I wiggle my toes, move my fingers, go through all the mental strain to try and get out of sleep paralysis. And again, it’s not reality. This loop happens three or four times until I finally wake up.


This has really been bothering my mental health lately and thinking about that awful, awful dream-state I get trapped in gives me heart palpitations and it makes me slightly panic.

Sleepparalysis,"12:53pm, and I just woke up from what I have been calling “sleep paralysis”

A few years ago, I noticed sleeping on my back lead to dreams that I would classify as SP, I was aware, scared, all that good stuff.

I stopped sleeping on my back, which worked until I noticed a new trigger, anxiety. When I was dreaming, and would get anxious, the dream would take a turn for the worst and bam, SP.

Now it doesn’t happen often, I think this is the 2nd time in about 6-8 months. 

Tonight, I drifted off to sleep, and “woke up” I saw white strands of light kinda flashing in and out but very dull, almost like transparent. I could not move, I was very panicky/shaky, I noticed my gf beside me turn so I was trying to scream to get her to help me, I couldn’t make any word come out of my mouth so I started breathing really hard to get her attention. It didn’t really work but whatever it was released me, and I was able to move and all that.

Sleepparalysis,"I used to have SP quite often, as a pre-teen. Back in where I am from we have lunch break for 2hr during school, meaning I would go home at 11:30am, have lunch, take a nap, and come back at 1:30pm. I always have SP while I’m taking these naps.

My naps are usually only 10-20min long, where I would fell in darkness with either no dream, or very vivid weird dreams. I am in my 20s now so could not remember anything of those dreams.

I would wake up before my alarm kicks off, where I cannot move or open my eyes. This is where weird stuff happens. I would have my eyes half opened (my eye lids were mostly closed, but I could sense the light and I can see outside from my memory). I can feel my limbs but it’s very difficult to move, I would hear noises and people talking, as if I’m in this big market or a room full of people. They talk, they laugh, I cannot understand them at all.

I would curse in my mind, stuff like “get the F out”, “F off you F A-hole”. In my culture we call SP “ghost on bed”, meaning you cannot move because you have a ghost on you. So I would curse on this “ghost” while trying my best to get out of the bed. 

Sometimes this works right away, sometimes I would fall back to SP after a moment of freedom. I never rly thought this is anything scary because, well, be a warrior and cursing at a ghost, then eventually kick them off me is quite cool.

Sleepparalysis,"I had a rough night of sleep leading up to this episode. It was around 6am and I was falling in and out of sleep, having scary dreams. On my second to last nightmare, I was in a forest and came upon a dark shed. I tried to get my phone out and turn the flashlight on, but my fingers wouldn't work. It tried to speak but when I opened my mouth I just heard static sounds. That's when I realized I was sleeping and tried to shake myself awake and couldn't move or speak and felt that awful sense of dread and I could feel a dark presence in my room. I got out of it, but immediately started slipping back into another nightmare. This time I was walking along a dirt road in a small village, and two men grabbed me and one of them started groping me. At this point I realized this was another dream, forced myself to wake up, but I was face down and couldn't move at all. The worst part is I could still feel the men's hands on me in my private areas and I couldn't do anything about it except struggle and whimper and panic quietly until I came out of it.

Sleepparalysis,"Common question, I know. But I've gotten more and more curious to see if it was SP or just a very vivid dream. 

It was about a year or two ago. I laid down for a nap around noon. Don't remember what position I was in, but I tend to fall asleep on my stomach and either end up on my side or back when I wake up. Anyways, I remember faintly seeing a shadow being in the corner of my room. It was either a little girl or a short woman with long scraggly hair and two small glowing eyes. As far as I know, she just stood there (she was very polite lmao), but most of the experience felt like a blur. Like the room and girl were very vivid, but I can't remember the experience itself. All I know is that I went back to sleep (either for real, or in my vivid dream), then proceeded to have one of the most vivid and terrifying nightmares I'd ever had. Thankfully woke up afterwards and I brushed it off easily (nightmares aren't uncommon with me) but I've always wondered if the first half was SP or not.

Sleepparalysis,"For a long time my SP was just a black shadow, shaped sometimes like a human. But more often a ghost-like figure. I didn’t mind it - it never did anything to me. It just watched me lay there sleeping knowing I couldn’t move, and then it would walk away and then I would wake up. The last couple years it’s been trying to impersonate people I know. And I don’t see it anymore, I just SENSE it. One time I could sense it was trying to be an old roommate, another time my sister. Neither time I believed it because it didn’t have the walk of those people and/or something about where it was approaching me wouldn’t make sense for where these loved ones would approach me.

Sleepparalysis,"
It hasn’t happened in over 7 years. 
I had completely forgotten about it.  At this age I am now, 37 - I never thought I would experience this again after having experienced it my whole life.  Here it goes. 

12/24/22 — approx. 3:50-4am est: 

Going to sleep Part 1:  I fell asleep normally, peacefully. The dream was maybe 10-20 min long?  I was in a strange room. 3 large husky hands reached from behind me, grabbed me from the back.   I can feel and see their hands and arms reach over to grab my wrists. They pulled, and I immediately knew I was sleeping, I wanted out of the dream. I force myself to wake up.  In  the dream, I said “No no, not this, wake up, wake up, wake up” My eyelids heavy, extremely hard to pry open. After what felt like 50 seconds - I got out. I recognized it at that time as a normal lucid dream. I fall right back asleep seconds later.  I’m tired. I didn’t think too much of it. 

Few minutes pass, then I’m in this dream again

Part 2:  I’m back in the same room. This time I decide to explore it.  I’m familar with it, being from the first dream, I feel like I know the room, but it feels warped(?) like it’s not mine, but it’s not necessarily scary either. 
The lights don’t really turn off.  I see a few flickering in other rooms, calling my attention to them. I play around with the switches. I walk from room to room. It almost felt like these “Entities” created this room for me to feel safe in, like it’s my home, but it’s definetly was not. 

I see the bed again, and I figured I want to move onto another dream so I’ll hop into this dream bed, and go to play sleep.  I get into bed and sleep.  
I wake up in the same dream, in the same room.  Again more than one presence of a man hovering over me. I’m confused as to why they’re not revealing who they are in the dream. They typically have some sort of figure or face. This time they tried to hold me down. I freak out, and I immediately try to scream for my teenage boys (in real life) I struggle to yell for help. “Help!”  I start violently shaking in the dream to wake myself up, as these men hold my eyes shut now.  Like they placed a hood over my eyes.  It’s black. My eyes are opening up in real life because I see my actual bedroom, and my nightstand, but I’m still forced to be in this fking room with these men at the same time in the dream.
I’m stuck in between sleep and in awake state.  I shake harder and force my eyelids open. They felt glued down! It was so frustrating, it must’ve taken 2-3 minute to fully open, but I finally got them to open!

I wake up in real life. I told myself, ok this time I’m going to drink water. I drank my water, adjusted my body, and give it a few minutes.  I picked up my phone as to prove to myself I’m awake. I did not want to go back to that nightmare. It was getting silly at this point.  I figured it might’ve been the Tom Waits albums I was listening to, lol combined with the Artwork I was looking at all night, Prior. 

2 minutes later, I allowed myself to go back in. I fall asleep. 

Part 3 (The Final Straw): I wake up a third time in the room, on this dream rooms’ bed, not mine, same position I was in, but this time they were waiting for me, I heard them telepathically talking to me and eachother and immediately held me down in bed and started touching my body.  It was so uncomfortable! I felt extremely violated. They were trying to put something under my stomach, like to poison me to keep me asleep. 

“Ok I’m fking scared now. Nope!”
 I Yell “HELP! HELP!” And this time I woke myself up immediately with my actual voice. 
I audibly (in real life) said help in a muffled voice, the boys didn’t wake up.  I woke up. I sat up in bed. I tried to knock myself awake completely.  I looked around my room. At the windows for light, Everything is completely fine. I re-adjusted, and didn’t want to go back to that, so I changed music on my iPad and picked up my phone and started writing this.  

It’s now 6:39am est: 

Phew! I haven’t been hesitant to sleep since 2004-2005 When I had a similar experience to this. But that one involved an IRL presence in the room, and lucid dreaming combined. 
 I actually woke up my sister crying screaming, and she came to me on that one.  It was evil, and I knew it was. I was fully awake hearing it in my room with me in real life, and I heard it moving, next to my body, and felt its actions while I was fully awake. 

I just thought I was done with it. 
Its been 7 years, I had a divorce, I moved 3xs, I’ve changed careers, I went on with my life. And now it’s back. 
 
I’m very rational person. The rational explanation is just getting over being sick + melatonin, and crazy music? 
I’m not scared, but after 3xs in one night, it’s kind of alarming to fall back. Any of you guys went years without experiencing it? Then BAM!

Sleepparalysis,I’m wondering if anyone has experienced this entity. This happened a few years ago. I was sleeping next to my boyfriend and I “woke up” In a dream and I saw this gremlin looking creature standing in the corner of the bedroom ( think of Gollum from lord of the rings) I get scared bc it’s my same exact bedroom with everything exactly how our room is. when I look at him he immediately jumps on my bed and wakes me up. I’m terrified bc I’m waking up in real and I still feel his presence in our bedroom. I fall back asleep and he’s now at my boyfriend’s side of the bed and jumps on me again and I wake up again.

Sleepparalysis,"TW: creepy, mention of what some might consider shadow people, brief mention (but no details) of assault

I feel like I need to share this because it is my strangest and most vivid sleep paralysis experience to date. Any feedback or questions or comments are welcome, it happened months ago and it is STILL weirding me out. 

First some background and other episodes: A few years ago after experiencing a random attack walking home at night one evening (luckily escaped the situation with only minor bruises), I started having sleep paralysis, I assume brought on by PTSD. It's almost always a dark shadowy still figure, or no figure but just a DEEP sense of danger/fear and something there that was too dark to see or behind my back (now I pretty much always have to sleep with my back towards the wall with my bed in the corner). The second most vivid thing I saw was a figure at the foot of my bed. This vision would actually become my ""dad""- although I didn't see his actually like-ness or features - it was something that felt safe and warm like my dad just checking on me, UNTIL I looked away! Then it would become a dark figure and feel evil, and almost felt like I would see a menacing grin in the corner of my eye as I looked away. SUPER CREEPY. But, as you can tell, I still didn't SEE super clear details it was mostly based on feelings. Although I should note I am always sure I am in my bed and in my apartment, so I can kind of see my room. 

NOW, the craziest and most vivid sleep paralysis I had! So in this episode I ""woke up"" and there was this GIANT, ORANGE, hornet-like creature hovering above me in my bed and I was kind of sitting up. It was glowing and very vibrant and felt menacing but I wasn't sure what it wanted and it wasn't harming me, but I thought it was what was paralysing me. (It's been months since this happened but maybe it was kind of scanning me in some way.) I REALLY thought to myself ""oh this is an alien abduction and people who have claimed such things aren't crazy after all!"" (except with a lot more expletives). I tried so hard to move but I couldn't, just like it other sleep paralysis episodes. This time was different though because I actually MANAGED to MOVE! (I usually can't) It took ALL my effort, but I swung and arm to swat it and actually MADE CONTACT (I have never ""moved"" or touched/felt anything in other episodes). But as soon as I made contact I got this kind of electric shock that made me grab onto the thing and I couldn't let go (like an electric fence). And also at that point these small centipede-like things started crawling from the hornet alien thing, up my arm to my body, and these things seemed like probes (think The Matrix). I definitely felt in danger, like this thing was going to hurt me or abduct me or wanted samples or something. I don't remember it making any noise except MAYBE the hum from it ""flying"" above me or vibrating, but I may be adding that as a false memory. But it definitely didn't try to communicate in any form. Anyway, at some point I woke up and was FREAKED OUT. Relieved, but it felt so real that the freaked-out feeling definitely lingered much longer and stronger than usual. I had to sleep with the lights on, ALL of them, not just a night light. It was just crazy to me because I really DON'T have a vivid, visual, picture-based imagination. My ""mind's eye"" is just a dark void, I don't picture scenery from descriptions in novels, etc. I've just never had a sleep paralysis episode where the thing out to get me was SO real and I could actually really see what it was and physically interact with it. Also it wasn't like a creature from any TV or movies I could think of. It's weird to NOT really see details of my dad, which would make sense that it's already memories/based on reality, but then see details of this completely invented creature. 

So... anyone else ever see a huge orange hornet alien thing during an SP episode? XD I think just some acknowledgement of how bizarre that is would make me feel better! Thanks in advance :) 

Other info:

I don't do drugs and I am pretty positive I hadn't been drinking that night.

 I have had a hand full of lucid dreams in my life.

 As a kid I used to have lots of nightmares about aliens, I had a mix of fear and fascination. Now, I have an apartment on a high floor of an apartment building and sleep building where I see all sky and can see blinking lights of planes and such going by constantly, some things look strange but I mostly got used to the types of lights I would see, but maybe it contributed to me thinking of UFOs and aliens.",t2_6zyk0f7u,0,Weird Orange Hornet Alien Thing during Sleep Paralysis Episode,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,zttnco,True,Annawalksparis,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zttnco/weird_orange_hornet_alien_thing_during_sleep/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zttnco/weird_orange_hornet_alien_thing_during_sleep/,53477.0,1671832297,0,,False,1671832316,1671832317,2022-12-23 21:51:37,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"
So backstory first. I’ve had sleep paralysis as early as maybe 10 or so at least 12 for sure — but my memory is often a bit terrible and this event just happened and didn’t want to wait to make this post when my memory of it isn’t as fresh. So when I experienced sleep paralysis for the first few times it was quite scary as once can imagine. I never said anything about this to anyone. I was actually quite closed off from everybody was going through it during my adolescent years. I eventually did get curious one time and learned you could do it by lying on your back and not moving for x amount of time and ect. I attempted it one day and it worked!!!! idk why i tried it to be honest like I knew it was scary but i was incredibly impulsive and didn’t think things through.I never saw anything that I can remember but it would last about 10 mins(?) at least it felt that way to me so it could also not be accurate. I didn’t think I actually had a bad sleep paralysis issue as opposed to how often others would get it. I would experience this type of event on average 2-4x a year. It actually stopped happening about 6-7 years ago until recently in this past year where we are now!


A few months ago I was taking a nap on my couch during the day when all of a sudden I got sleep paralysis, only this time it was a bit different. I knew I had sleep paralysis and I was “awake ?” to the point where I knew I wanted to snap out of it and just wake up. I tried getting up and it was like working kind of but it felt like I was dragging my body to get up. My body felt heavy and really felt like I was fighting gravity. I could see but also not like I see when I’m awake going to work doing everyday things. It almost looked a bit blurry like smudged but not bad like how some see without glasses if their prescription wasn’t too bad. So eventually I got like exhausted almost and just decided to feel my arm and my hand but I couldn’t feel it. Tbh it felt like when your hand goes to sleep or your leg before the tingling happens and you touch it with a body part that isn’t and you can’t really feel like ? Like that. (I kept a lot of notes for reference bc of my poor memory) anyway I was in and out of it and eventually I get to a point where I see myself from a 3rd person and now I’m walking ???? But I’m not because I’m still laying on my couch and it just goes back and forth with that until I eventually the night thing I remember is going back to sleep and waking up shortly after In extreme confusion. 

Next event today. I tried to go back to sleep and I thought I was sleeping till I wasn’t. I was going in and out of consciousness at first then I was again “awake?” With the weird blurry vision stuff and it felt darker than normal. So I again tried to wake up but it felt heavy and like I was dragging my body  . I was tossing and turning doing everything and I felt the edge of my bed and it truly felt like I was making progress because at first I was in the middle and my bed is quit big and now I’m actually at the end of my bed I could feel it. But for some reason I wasn’t getting any more awake It felt like heavy head pressure and I felt upside down like I felt the pallet that my bed is on with my hand and it felt like I was going to fall off my bed. I got scared and just tried to stay on the edge and sleep. I woke back up but was actually in the same position and place as before I tried to drag myself off the bed but I don’t remember going back to the center where I was originally. Then again I felt awake but this time my eyes were shut and I felt my S/O come from behind me and cuddle me but I was trying to say don’t do that I’m trying to wake up and I can’t but it felt like I was mumbling cuz it was very hard to move my lips. He talked back to me and then I don’t remember what happened right after that but he was gone and my S/O wasn’t actually there because he was at work during this time. The last thing that happened during this event is also quite scary, this time my eyes were open as usual during sleep paralysis but I saw what looked like my son and he was in front of the window and I we exchanged some words but he also looked more like a shadow than anything and this could have been my son actually but he says it wasn’t when I asked him later if he came into my room. I went back to sleep eventually and woke up in extreme confusion once again and called my S/O because I had a missed call from him because again he was at work.

Sleepparalysis,"This morning I woke up from a nightmare, to that https://imgur.com/a/YAtqhBN.

This is the view from my bed, and it did appear super contrasty and black and white like that. 

Of course my brain made a demon out of the shelves, like a silhouette guy with a big square head and some kind of hat, leaning over me. At first it scared the shit out of me, but it didn't move (it is a bunch of shelves) so i was quickly more concerned with the fact that i couldn't move.

I knew about sleep paralysis, but what i didn't know is that you can't feel how long it lasts. This crisis felt like several hours, but might have been just a few minutes, i won't know.

The other thing is that as i tried to move, i felt like i was rolling over and managing to move at some point, but each time i realised i didn't move an inch and this was really distressing, i was feeling trapped as fuck.

When it was over something funny happened, i fell into another dream, where i told my family i had sleep paralysis. Finally i woke up, able to move (each move felt like heaven, i have never been so delighted to slightly tilt my head), and then i went to tell my family about the crisis, they don't know about SP so they thought i was telling bullshit, which is annoying.

Sleepparalysis,"
I’ve dealt with this all of my life since childhood. I’m a male 29 years now. Still at times sleep paralysis will happen, and I know the routine. Move my toes first, then some other part of my body to gain control again and snap out of it. There have been a couple of times though where my episodes are so severe that I feel myself and hear myself. My body fighting extra hard to gain control from whatever presence is holding me down my face shaking hard, so much to the point I hear my cheeks on my face flapping. Kind of scares me honestly and I can still feel it now on my face a little after as I’m writing this. I don’t accept the idea of astral projecting.

Sleepparalysis,"I had my first experience with sleep paralysis only a week ago, and my latest experience was last night.

The first time I experienced sleep paralysis was after falling back asleep, after waking up in the middle of the night. I fell asleep watching one piece with my LED’s on and woke up to the same thing. When I fell back asleep it all started. The first two times were in the same night, I woke up twice that night and couldn’t go back to sleep out of shock and terror. But they both had a similar theme , my back was turned away from my bedroom door, and I was facing the wall. The first time I felt like I woke up and couldn’t move my body almost  entirely , I could barely move my fingers tho, eventually I wiggled them enough to snap out of it and woke up. I went back to sleep… 

I awoke again with the same feeling as before , couldn’t move at all besides the slightest movements in my fingers. Although this time was a lot more terrifying. I laid there helplessly as I felt a presence in the room , moments  later I felt something getting closer. Before I knew it something was touching my back , I can’t remember exactly how whether it was aggressive or not but either way was very creepy.

The craziest one so far was my most recent experience, I can’t even shake the memory off because of how scary it was. I woke up in the middle of the night to the same old stuff, thought to myself surely I won’t have another experience like last time. I fell asleep once again. I awoke to an unmoving body , this time I was facing the door. This time, I knew something bad would happen. Black cracks started appearing around my door slowly, there was a feeling of a presence around me. A blurry figure of a tall women , with black hair and a white dress appeared in front of the door . I desperately tried to wake up by gathering all my strength into one arm and tried to move , thankfully I was able to slightly and it snapped me out at that moment….

Basically what’s been happening is very regularly I will fall asleep and I’ll get a sort of sinking feeling and then instantly feel stuck, like if fell off something and finally hit the ground. I can move but I can hear stuff, what I’ve commonly heard is plain static, like that kind of static when you turn on the TV to a Channel that doesn’t exist and it’s just heavy static, or screams, I’ve never seen anything because I’m almost always facing close to a wall or my blankets cover my eyes. I also sometimes feel like I can almost start to fly, obviously still in bed I just feel like I can jump out of where I am and fly. One of the biggest things that happened that really scared me was a feeling that everything repeated. I remember I woke up and felt like I was stuck and I tried to tell my Alexa to turn my LEDS on, when I tried talking it felt like I was whispering so quiet i don’t even know if it was all in my head, but when I whispered my lights turned on and then I snapped back to the same situation like 10 seconds before where my lights were off i and kept trying to get them on.

Sleepparalysis,"At this point, this is documentation. Hopefully writing it down will make my brain subconsciously rationalize or sort it out. 

As the title says, this is the 4th time I've had SP, and it's been a few months since my last one while I was in Texas at my parents house, and probably the most frightening. 

Maybe 3 or 4am, in a dream state perhaps, I was sleeping on my left side and hazily opened my eyes. I was able to look to my right at the ceiling fan (with my eyes only, didn't move head). My gaze fell to the left slowly (now im looking straight ahead) and I could see it into the hallway to my boys' room door.

That's when the figure came into focus, just out of my line of sight as I stared at my boys room door. Almost like a jump scare scene out of a movie, where the antagonist was there the whole time and then moves suddenly; that's what this was like. 

As soon as I saw this figure, with what looked like had long and dark black hair, it quickly reached under my sheets with both hands to under my left shoulder in what I guess was an attempt to lift me up. 

I distinctly remember telling myself, ""You're awake! Wake up! This is a dream!""

After saying that, I tried moving and couldn't budge. I looked down at my hands to try and move them, they were crossed over eachother (wrist to wrist; right over left). While I was looking at my hands, this figure seemed to flip end over end down to the foot of the bed, like a gymnast doing a back hand spring. 

I started becoming frustrated at myself that I couldn't rouse myself, so I thought my wife must be behind me,  I could try kicking backwards to get her attention. I don't know where this figure was at now, to my knowledge it seemed to disappear. 

I tried kicking backwards but my right leg didn't respond to my commands. Like a stubborn dog that won't drop the remote. I tried again and again until I was able to take a deep breath which seemed to re-energize my body to where I was able to fully wake. 

After looking around, my chest was pounding and I was cold with goosebumps, even under two thick blankets. As of this writing, nearly 3 hours later I assume, I feel fine. I don't have a fever or chills and feel completely normal.

Sleepparalysis,"It's 5 am as I'm typing this and as I was trying to fall asleep I felt my body become numb and nearly paralyzed so I knew I was falling into sleep paralysis. The only way I've found is to try shaking my head with all my strength to snap out of it. This happens randomly some nights but this night was different. Before this happened I was having multiple short dreams. My dreams are always very realistic so It's hard for me to try and lucid dream because it's difficult to tell if it's even a dream. These dreams weren't necessarily scary but they just felt eery and weird, all happening within the house I'm in. Anyways after waking up after the last dream, I tried going to sleep for the eighth or whatever time I couldn't even keep track. I felt my body going into sleep paralysis but this time I was hearing gunshots and flashing images of my house and a random doll thing that idek how to describe. This was by far the hardest one to snap out of it took multiple tries and I was petrified. I managed to snap out of it and now I'm scared of going back to sleep. It's nearly 6am and I'm probably just going to stay awake all night, I don't have anything important tomorrow anyways. Does anyone else experience this?

Sleepparalysis,"I never experienced SP. I learned abt sleep paralysis from my friend when we were at school. She explained that black thing comes and suffocates her. She's sure that it's a real demon. And she said that after she turned into religion SP was gone. She puts on religious audio texts for a sleep.

When I learned that this black thing common with almost everyone experiencing SP I was really concerned. Till now it's a mystery for me. 

Like ok body paralyses ok mb it's time for nightmares. But why demon? Why it's trying to suffocate sleeper? To touch and to scare etc. I'm an atheist but this thing really puzzles me. What if everything religious folk say true? What if evil entities always hunt for our souls? 

I have read few articles trying to scientifically explain that. Like it's from our ancestors who had to fear things in the darkness. But I don't find it convincing.

Sleepparalysis,"i always have weird recurring nightmares, and ive been having them for awhile but i dont know anyone else who has the same experience, so im not sure if its sleep paralysis or just nightmares

when it starts i feel it flood my body kinda, and as soon as i feel it coming its too late. i try as hard as i can to move, and during them it often feels like im spinning or shifting in my bed but when i wake up i havent moved at all. these episodes are very short tho. 

i just had one of these episodes a couple minutes ago, and id describe it if i could but their very frantic and weird. the one i just had was dark, and there was some light but everything i could see was constantly morphing, all while i heard static before people screaming in my ears. i was hit with these feelings of dread, and being trapped. the whole dream just felt like struggling. i also get crazy physical sensations during these, like my heart is gonna explode or something. it just feels like every part of me is fighting myself if that makes sense, and all my senses are maxed out.

i remember one of these episodes super vividly, everything was hyper-saturated and red, and there was some static but my view was through the scope of a gun, and i saw a man walking before i shot him in the head and watched him suffer and flail, all through the view on the scope. it was crazy cuz every part of me didnt want it to shoot but i didnt have control, and again i felt like my body was spinning while i was dreaming. i could hear radio beeps and people screaming and it was all so freaky. especially the whole dream, it was so random, i dont have trauma from going to war or anything lol im a 16 yr old girl in grade 11 LOL

Sleepparalysis,"So, I’ve had sleep paralysis all my life. I can remember having it back in my early teens for the first time and freaking the hell out lol. 

I had sleep paralysis about 10 minutes ago that I’m still shaken up over, and honestly I’m pretty scared to go back to sleep. I was laying on my back, couldn’t move, eyes open, the works; I’d go into more detail explaining it, but I’m new to this subreddit and figure most people know the tell tale signs of SP? 

Anyways, I was laying on my back, and I just couldn’t breath. No auditory hallucinations, no imagery like vaguely human shaped figures (what I normally see), nothing sitting on or pressing down on my chest, I just couldn’t breath. I felt myself struggling and moving my chest in a futile attempt to get my lungs working. It didn’t last for long, thankfully, but I’m terrified.

Sleepparalysis,"I had a dream I needed surgery, I was awake in preop, I was awake until I was on the operating table. When I closed my eyes I couldn't wake up. I couldn't move and there was nothing I could do and I tried screaming but I feel like only I could hear it and I was scared because I thought I was going to be like that for three hours. 

A few years ago I had a similar dream. I had a dream that my job was under attack. They had guns and one grabbed me and pulled the trigger and everything went black. I didn’t wake up from my dream. But I was no longer dreaming. I was in the black void where I couldn’t wake up and  I remember thinking, “oh my god, am I dying ? I don’t want my sister to find me”.  

Anyway, is this sleep paralysis? Everyone I’ve talked to with a sleep paralysis experience has opened their eyes and just couldn’t move or they have seen like someone standing in their room. 

Maybe I’m not understanding it correctly ?

Sleepparalysis,"(23F) So the first time I experience SP, I was 15 &amp; so confused. After some research I was super interested and began researching AP and succeeded in doing it, visiting some friends houses, and this huge white place with a huuuge white meeting table. Was trying to blend in but my thoughts were too loud and someone noticed I was there and banished me. 

Fast forward to living in a haunted house 2020-2021, I had SP so bad; a red and black demon with scales was grabbing my face, forehead to forehead screaming/growling at me. I didn’t flinch or react, I knew they fed off of fear. If anything I thought “Wow, this is weird. Not scary at all. Kind of embarrassing for you”. &amp; the demon got offended, stopped screaming, and vanished. 

I have a ton of stories like this, I learned how to control my SP because I didn’t want to try AP again until I have a black cat, &amp; I live at my moms who is allergic to cats. 

Well TODAY, I had SP for the first time in over a year— So my first thought was to try to beat it. I tried sitting up &amp; was almost thrown back down and my neck made dramatic cracking noises. Tried to pick (what I thought was) my phone up; I looked down at it, and there was an oval shape and it was almost translucent. I held it up to get a better look and the boarder vanished as the oval shape was actually my mirror on the wall in front of me; the boarder of my phone “vanished” when it matched up with the wall. At the same time, someone/something is tugging at my feet/legs, while a crinkly noise is happening under my (turned off) TV. Once I realized I was in it no matter how much I knew, I attempted to AP for the first time in over a year. As I did, all these sound affects/pressure by my legs got more intense— then I snapped out of it and was back to normal. 

Going to try to go back in. I’m not scared anymore, and I think the cosmos need me.

Sleepparalysis,"Im here to tell you about my new experience of sleep paralysis i just had. I came to write this almost right after i woke up. 

This took me almost 2 hours to write because i had to think really hard for all the things that happened, but everything you are about to read i swear is 100% real. Even tho there was things that happened but i cant remember anymore.

I went to sleep, i was watching this one series on the background and after a while i started having ""normal"" sleep paralysis, started hearing that usual humming sound and i knew it was about to come. I didnt want to experience that again so i forced myself to get up, I closed tv and went to sleep on bed. I was lying on my back and closed my eyes, not much time passed and I was in sleep.

I have had sleep paralysis's many, many times, but what is about to happen next was something else. 

I felt pressure, first on my feet, then knees, ect. It was moving up, very slowly. When it got my head, it stopped for a second and then i \_felt\_ how it looked like, only thing i saw was black, but i still knew what he looked like, i heard him saying words that i have never heard before, whispering to my ears. Then it started floating towards ceiling and grabbed me with him, i literally felt how my back bended, like in paranormal activity scenes, head still on my pillow and feet on bed, but back very bended, it scared the shit out of me because it felt very real. I managed to force myself awake just to note that i was still in same exact position as i was when i went to sleep. So like back in the days when i had my first paralysis's, i wanted to explore it more, so i closed my eyes again, and about 20 seconds later, same strange feeling came back, and moments later i was again with this thing. 

This time i was aware that it's only some kind of state of sleep paralysis, so i didnt want to wake up, but to see where it goes. 

First came the pressure feeling, not slowly like last time, but whole body at once, like it continued from the state where it last left. My back started bending again, but when it was bended as much as human body can bend, i felt myself raising from the bed, i felt i was in the air, just floating. And then this ""Demon"" started it's dancing. I felt how it came close to my body, like it was lying on me, then slowly we both started to go down on the bed, but this bed was not there anymore, we were just falling down in the darkness. 

At this point i was very curious about what was going on, how is this happening, why it's feeling so real. I remember thinking about going as far as possible to see what's coming. So i just let it happen.

After falling for like 10 seconds, I remember this thing starting to rotate around my body. When it was behind me, i sort of felt it all over my back, like i was laying on him, and after few seconds, i was back in my bed. But it wasn't still over, it was just a beginning.. When i was again on my bed, after a few seconds i felt it lying beside me, rolling over my body and lifted me in sitting position, i remember this thing was sitting on me, face to face, but without faces because all this time i didnt see anything, only ""felt"" it's figure. Then it grabbed my head and started pushing he's sharp fingers in my head, i remember it was hurting so i pinched this thing, and it didnt like it. First it took his fingers out of my head, and then very aggressively ""kissed"" me. Yes, kissed. I remember how i felt like my teeth's was about to brake in to my mouth when he pushed that hard, i started fighting back and tried to push him away, then all hell let loose. It took very hard grip off me and rolled over to the floor, but none of this hurt, all the environment was soft, like we were fighting on clouds, but i still knew we were in my bedroom.

I got to say that at this point of writing it's been almost an hour when this happened, and i cant clearly remember everything that happened, but I try to explain as clearly as i remember..

When it took me to the floor it wasn't playing anymore, it was very aggressive. And from my part, it wasn't just ""happy research"", it was surviving. But still, i wanted to see what happens, so i continued. 

When we got to the floor, me lying on ground on my back and this thing sitting on my body, it started speaking again, but like before it was ""soft and gentle"" voice, this time it was demonic, and angry. Like he didnt want me to fight back. He came back close to my body and we rolled under the bed, and that's where things became scary, and i almost wanted to force myself to wake up. I felt that we went in some kind of bigger space, and it started to play and do some experiments with me. I felt like i was in space, no gravity or any environment. First i started to hear my cousin's voice, and he was speaking in my language, but i cant remember the words he said, but one thing i remember was that he said my brother's name, nothing else. They are like two of the closest persons in my life, so i dont know if some kind of defense mechanism tried to take control, or at least that's what it felt like at that point. I heard his voice like for 5 seconds, then out of nowhere, this Demon came back, this time i saw some of how it looked like, it was very thin, very long arms and very long and sharp fingers, i dont remember seeing he's legs, only upper body. Head looked like Venom, from the movie. Bald, round, very sharp teeths. It was reaching for me like you would imagine someone reaching you underwater. 

Then when it was about to catch me, suddenly he disappeared. After like 5 seconds I started to hear music. I knew that song, but cant remember it anymore, it's from 1970's or 80's, and it sounded like it came from very old tv, static sound. That music played for like 20 seconds, but not the whole song like it goes, just chorus, over and over again. Music started to fade little by little, i started to hear this demon voice in the background. At this point i realised i wasn't in that space environment anymore, i was on the floor, next to my bed. When i realised it, that same second this Demon showed no mercy again. He grabbed my mouth and tried to rip my mouth open, i remember that hurting a lot and actually feeling like my jaw was about to break, i started wriggling and pushing him away, but he wasn't stopping, i grabbed from his flank area and started pinching, or pushing as hard as i could, i remember trying to push my fingers through he's body. But then it got very mad. He grabbed my head with both of his hands and started eating my brain, i remember this hurting so bad that i couldn't handle it anymore. I forced myself up from that ""nightmare"", even tho it wasn't, or atleast didnt feel like nightmare, but actual thing. When i got awake, i still felt a little ""pain"", or not pain, but pressure on top of my head right where he ate my brain. It lasted for like 5 minutes.

Without lying i've had almost 30 sleep paralysis cases in my life, and i can say the difference between nightmare and these, and for a fact i can say this wasn't just a nightmare. I dont know what it was, maybe there are different levels of sleep paralysis's, but this was first time for me when this ""Demon"" took control that hard, i have never felt pain in these before, only feeling of pressure. I dont know what is wrong with me but i hope to have this happen to me again some day, just to do some research again. I got to say that i believe in supernatural things and to that that there is something much bigger going on in this universe. Like these sleep paralysis events cant come from just nowhere. Right?

Well, there's some tin foil hatting in the end but it makes this life more interesting.

Sleepparalysis,"I’m usually the person who prides themselves with sleep, I was the person who’d always sleep at least 6 plus hours each night anything below makes me feel so tired and groggy but this time it’s different. My mothers ill so ill that her coughs are so bad it sounds like she’s choking and is about to throw up. When I sleep I need it to be silent or to have very distant background noise. I’m a person who doesn’t do well with sleeping with music in there ear. My mum was keeping me awake and unfortunately I couldn’t really do anything to help her, I tried sleeping but her coughs and groans in pain were keeping me awake. Last night I had to stay awake until 7am in the morning to finally get some sleep since that’s the time my mum woke up and sat in the living room. 

Another night of me tossing and turning trying to sleep. Id sleep for a few minutes or a few seconce before I woke up again. It was around 5 or 6am when I fell asleep. I was on my side which is unusual since usually it’s most common to have those episodes on your back. As I was sleeping I feel this man sitting on my bed watching me, he was watching me and I had to pretend I was asleep and every time I moved my finger he would move them back into it’s original place. Everytime he touched my arm or my back I could feel his hands and they had a tingling sensation on my body. I remember hearing him say a few things. At first he spoke as if he didn’t know I was awake and said “we need to get her ready” whatever that means which is ominous af. Then he talked as if he knew I was awake and said “stop struggling” every time I moved my fingers. And while I was in this dream? idk I had this very massive sense of urgency to wake up. My brain was like pleading me to wake up and to get out of there. I did and I am very confused it’s almost 10am I’m still so tired and hungry.

Sleepparalysis,"I've thankfully only experienced sleep paralysis almost every day when i was 16-17. Its gotten on and off for the past 10 years. The difference in my expiriences from then to now are so so crazy. 
I would feel this overwhelming sense of absolute dread. My vision would blur to black starting at the edges of my sight until it was all dark. Feeling the most fear I had no idea existed. I'd see actual figures. Standing or perched in corners of my ceiling.
I started expecting the episodes. If I could feel it coming I'd shut my eyes tight and count it out until I could move again.
One time I fell asleep on my desk in high-school and experienced sleep paralysis. I counted down and waited. My best friend who sat next to me, told me my eyes were wide open when last time she glanced they were shut and I did not respond to her trying to wake me up.
Now
I hear what I can only describe as a tuning fork. I shut my eyes because I'm used to sleep paralysis episodes. (after 10 years on and off) I shut my eyes. I see colors, and hear awful awful noises. comparable to metal crashing. a car accident 5 feet away. screaming but it's not human. Animal? Maybe. I dunno 
The colors I see are best comparable to when you shut your eyes in broad daylight and press on your shut eyes. Or a Samsung galaxy screen saver

Sleepparalysis,"I was really hoping this would never happen to me but here I am unfortunately. Just had my first sleep paralysis experience.
Indescribable. It’s like a nightmare but this one is worse coz you’re actually awake, it’s not just a dream.
So I didn’t realise what was happening at first. It had started with hearing some noises at first which I thought were coming from one of the rooms in my flat (I live in student accommodation), I first heard pots and pans and dishes clinking together so I thought ok either someone in their room or in the kitchen. 
But then I heard breathing. Like wayyyy too clearly to be coming from another room. It literally sounded like it was breathing from behind me, around the bottom of my bed. 
This is when I try to get up and have a look around and yea I couldn’t move. 
I just remember thinking “omg I’m having sleep paralysis I need to do something I need to wake up”.
It was hard to even keep my eyes open. Not much more happened for a little while until I managed to open my eyes properly a little bit and I saw the shadow of a big claw on my wall. Then I forced my eyes shut coz I was terrified. I kept trying to make noises but it just felt like air in my throat and no noise was coming out. I remember the meat on my bones literally quivering but I couldn’t actually move.
I realised I came out of it when finally let out a kind whimper form trying to make noise so hard.

Sleepparalysis,"Just a heads up this is a pretty long and eerie dream. 
TLDR at bottom

So in my dream I’m trying to drive home and for some reason I’m driving my moms car. I’m going down a Main Street I know and I pass my turn, I think no problem I’ll make a u-turn. Go up the road and you can’t make a u-turn where I thought you could previously so I decide to go to the light and just turn left. After I take the left and go down the road there are people walking across the street into my lane and I don’t see their faces, I’m pretty sure these people were coming from a hospital. 

Then somehow I end up in a hospital with a handful of other people. I decide to walk around and find the exit to get the car and continue to drive home. Im walking around the hospital and I can’t find the exit on the main floor so I decide to start changing floors then the hospital becomes a maze. 

I walk through rooms and see elderly and young people as I pass through rooms. I try to ask an elderly lady about the exit and I don’t think she could really say much. I remember walking passed a child and the child looking at me with intense light blue eyes and their eyes dilated really crazy when they looked at me and sort of started like bulging out of their head so I start moving quicker. 

I try retracing my steps and pass another kid with intense dark blue eyes with what looked like black specks I’m the blue. I decide not to keep eye contact with that kid. As I’m briskly walking around looking for an exit I see someone who I believe was from the group that started with me in the beginning of getting in the hospital talking to a lady who was very aggressive and speaking very mean. I think they were talking about how to get to the parking and the mean lady was pretty much telling her that she wouldn’t help or that you don’t get to the parking. 

I find stairs and decide I’m going down them because you would think parking would be on ground level. As I’m at the top of one flight of stairs I kind of trip and I am laying on my back at the top of the stairs. I then see the angry lady. She walks up to me while I’m on my back and when she gets close I grab her ankle. She asks why I grabbed her and I tell her that she seems like someone who would try to hurt me. Right after that she goes to kick me with the other foot. 

(In real life I used to train and compete in martial arts with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu being my main practice)

In my dream when she goes to kick me I arch my hips and wrap my legs around hers taking her down and putting her in an ankle lock and I start cranking her ankle. We roll about half way down the stairs but I’m in control. I’m hurting her and then I look up and see someone at the top of the stairs and I stop cranking the ankle lock and just hold her there. I tell her I will let her go and when I do she tries to stab me with a pen and like swipes the outside of my thigh then runs to the person at the top of the stairs momentarily obstructing my view of them. 

Now the person at the top of the stairs has their back to me and they change every time my view is obstructed while getting up. Started as a man with a definite face, then when it’s back was to me it was a woman, then a man again, then a woman with red hair in like a Bob cut when I walked up to it. 

I grab the shoulder and start to turn them around asking aggressively, “Who are you!” 
When I turn them around it’s just like an outer cloak with a dark shadow in the shape of a person. I say, “It’s you.” 

Then I try to fight them and can’t move well. I am sort of hitting the figure and it is doing nothing. I try waking up and nothing is working. I’m even peeling my eyelids up and I can’t open them. I’m only able to move one arm at this point and I feel pressure on my other arm and chest. I’m being held on the ground now and I decide I need to buck my hips and get up. 

I move my leg and I wake up. 

Before this I’ve only had one other similar experience. When I wake up I’m calm and rationalize it’s a messed up dream and possibly sleep paralysis because I have heard people talk about it. I turn to Reddit while the dream is still fresh and write this up. Tell me what you think. Has anyone else had experiences like this?

Sleepparalysis,"I only started having sleep paralysis after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, or at least that is when I noticed it being a problem. It wouldn’t happen often but it still did happen occasionally. I got put on a higher dose of antipsychotics and the problem went away. Recently my dose was lowered quite significantly because I was having other complications and the sleep paralysis is back worse than ever before. I’m having it both with and without hallucinations.

Sleepparalysis,"I've always gotten what I thought was sleep paralysis, but I thought that the actual paralysis part was a symptom that only happened most of the time. 

Every time I've had these hallucinations, I've tried to escape or get help. Screaming, sneaking out of the room quietly while the hallucination slept in my bed. 

In college I once scared the crap out of my roommate because I woke her up and asked her if she knew there was someone in the room. The beds were lofted and I was watching a figure shuffle around under her bed. 

Has anyone else had this experience? I have horrifying dreams constantly, recurring nightmares, and am typically irrationally angry if I'm disturbed in the mornings (although I only really know this because of my partner - I typically only remember snippets or the words I'm saying when I wake myself up yelling). There have also been a few instances where I'll wake up crying and be inconsolably anxious for hours with no explanation or reason. 

I might just need to have a sleep study done or something. I've started to wonder if this is like sundown syndrome or something though, even though I'm in my 20s. Is it an early sign of something? Any connections between sleep problems and issues later in life? Or do some people just have sleep problems and live normally otherwise?

Sleepparalysis,"My first time experiencing sleep paralysis was terrifying; However, it was a mild one  as compared to my third and final encounter . The first time I had sleep paralysis, was the summer of 2012. I was about to be a. Freshman in High-school. I had been watching the series “Ghost Hunters International” and was enjoying the episode when I guess I fell asleep.

I woke up in the middle of the night, which is common for me, especially in my teen years. I was lying on the right side of my body, in a semi-Fetal position. I didn’t move. I simple guided my eyes to the Television screen which was still playing re-runs of “Ghost Hunters International” I think it was a marathon going on that night or something. I watch the tv with my eyes lowering and then widening as I fight the sleep. It was the summer and my freshman year started in  a week or two, so I was trying to spend the least amount of time asleep to enjoy the last bit of summer. 

6-8 minutes roll by and once my grogginess is gone and I’m pretty much awake, I make the decision to get up and get some water from downstairs. I am unable to move.. I panicked. I immediately turned my attention to the tv and was under the impression that the ghost being hunted on the show was somehow possessing me through the TV. I can’t describe the terror of that thought. Truly one of the most bone chilling thoughts to run through my mind, given the circumstances. I eventually regained control starting with my toes and the feeling slowly working it’s way up my body.

I fetch my water while still shaking of fear, and confusion. I go back to bed…it happens again. I regain control quicker this time and didn’t panic.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello everyone! Can anyone please help me find out what is going on? Is there a professional I can recah out to? Has anyone ever had it? Does it have a name?

I very often have this problem, mostly when i dont have a specific time i need to wake up. It starts with a dream and then it keep developing (like, its not several different dreams, it the same that gets more complex). While in the dream, I often feel the need to solve whatever problem is going on, but it never really ends and there is always more and more things in the dream. 

It is pretty exhausting.

It can make me, wake up as late late as 3pm. Today I was only able to wake up at 1pm because my boyfriend called me on my phone! (went to bed at 2am, not ideal but c'mon, thats more than enough sleep). 

Before that, my dad even tried to wake me up at 10am. We interacted briefly, but like 5 secs after I was deep in my sleep again to the same freaking dream! Sometimes I will say nonsense things during these intercations and might not even remember. 

It is a lot of sleep, but they are mentally draining. It doesn't feel good like at all like simply having a lazy sunday time.

Sleepparalysis,"So currently 2:22am, have been awake for over an hour. Have a massive day tomorrow of work and moving house and I am seriously thinking I will probably just not go to sleep after this. I haven't experienced a nightmare since I was 15. I'm 27. Is this what sleep paralysis is? and am I safe to go back to sleep tonight or should I just stay awake? I cant experience this again it was seriously the most terrifying event of my entire life without question. 

I woke up in my bed and felt terrified. There was something in my room. It wanted me. It was holding me down. I desperately tried to move but I was frozen. I cannot stress enough how real it all felt, indistinguishable from me writing this right now. I tried and tried and slowly my limbs moved bit by bit while I was hyperventilating with terror and fear. I managed to stand up and slowly, so painfully slowly, walk to my door. I could feel the horrific and terrifying presence of this fucking thing that just felt so fucking evil. I couldn't really turn my neck and look around the room as my body was just so stiff. I shuffled the few metres around my bed and to my closed bedroom door. I managed to turn my neck slowly and saw my pedestal fan with the cage removed, blowing straight up vertically, with a plastic bag full of clothes hovering in the air above it. I reached for the door handle and opened the door, so damn slowly. I could see the stairwell outside my door that led upstairs to where my housemates rooms are, but I knew that there was no way I would be able to get myself up there. No way it would let me go up there. Suddenly I was dragged back onto the bed. Forcefully. While I tried with all I could to surge forward and through the door. But it had me on the bed. The door was still open and I was looking out. I desperately tried to scream my housemates names but all that came out were low moans, my voice would crack too as I screamed the word ""help"" and almost nothing came out. At this point it was maximum terror as I just tried as hard as I could to scream but the sounds that came out were so quiet. 

Then, suddenly, this rational part of my mind just said to me ""Joel, this cannot be happening to you. This must be a dream. This cannot be real and you need to wake up right now. WAKE UP.""

And suddenly I was awake, I almost felt like I had actually been moaning and talking? Not sure how to describe it. I frantically grabbed the remote next to my bed that turns on my ceiling light (thank god I have one of those because I don't think I would have been able to get out of my bed in the dark).

Sleepparalysis,"Some advice for friends who want to have an easier time-ik this sounds easier said than done BUT. 

Meditation has helped me deal with anxiety thruout the day. If I feel my heart rate speeding up I take deep breaths-automatically. My brain and my body just know to do it. Well I’ve noticed when I have sleep paralysis I just start taking deep breaths. If my heart is fast I hold my breath til I can relax. And it has CHANGED it all for me! 

That and writing down my dreams/sleep paralysis. It helps me remember and I’ve noticed I’ve been able to catch myself when I’m in sleep paralysis and remind myself it’s not real and I’m safe. This has a 60% success rate-which isn’t a lot but it’s better than a 0% success rate lol

Even though I didn't actually take the substance in my waking life I am convinced that I have due to the lucid dream so that when I go into SP I fully believe that I am experiencing drug psychosis or overdose from taking the substance earlier.

I wasn't aware enough that I could play around freely, but I was definitely aware I was in a dream. I remember trying to run as fast as I could and slide across the floor of the strange empty swimming pool, a kind of liminal space, my dream took place in.
However I then decided I would like to wake up, when I 'did', I found it to be EXTREMELY hard to move. My eyes also felt very heavy and it was an effort to keep them open.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi. I have no idea where else to look for answers so I decided to ask here.

SP is extremely rare for me. In fact, if I don't count the ones where a cat was in the room, there was only one that I remember. It felt like my soul was being pulled out of my body by a female figure (can't remember if it looked more like a girl or a woman). It happened at home and I sleep alone and have no pets.

Now, the other ones are different. I stay at my sister's place when I travel out of town to see my daughter. I sleep lightly when she's with me, because she pushes out the sheets often at night and I wake up by her movements and cover her. That can happen 5 times a night or less, but it was never an issue for me.

My sister has two cats, one of which is completely black and female. The room me and my daughter sleep has it's door closed and the cats don't bother me, but sometimes, like yesterday, we had to sleep in the main room where the cats can freely roam. This is where I have experienced sleep paralysis and it's the black cat every time. I feel her walking on the bed and there's trembling and noise. It's hard to describe. On a previous SP I'm sure I was awake and I was trying to keep my sight on the cat only to drift off for a second to feel pressure and noise from that direction. That happened several times.

I've seen people here saying that cats help them, but to me it seems like it's the opposite. I appreciate any feedback I can get on this.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve had sleep paralysis multiple times in my life that I now know when I’m in it, also with both audio and visual hallucinations. I’ve also felt as if gravity was pushing down harder since I couldn’t move anything.

However, during my last sleep paralysis episode I’ve felt something I’ve never experienced before. I could feel my heart beating what felt to be 200+ bpm. I can control my breathing during sleep paralysis, and taking deep slow breathes was not slowing down my heart rate. My heart was beating so fast it felt like it wasn’t beating right, and I honestly thought I was going to die.

Sleepparalysis,"So I just had a dream where I was experiencing sleep paralysis within the dream. So I was in my grandmothers neighborhood (It looks different in my dream and I've had the same dream numerous times getting off the bus and walking to her house. But instead I was running from something unknown). I then evaporated into my bedroom (The layout is different for some reason.) laying under my bed looking for someplace to hide. I then could not control myself and someone walked into my bedroom; I can not really describe it but there were like many black figures coming in. The first few came in and tickled my feet, I was home alone and tried to call my mom and 911 but it didn't work, instead the figures laughed at me and continued to torture me. They then went away, then a couple seconds later some more came in. 3 of then went into my closet and you could see them like playing through the crack of the door. The 4th one sat there and tickled my feet, she then dug her nails into my upper left arm and it felt like a hole was there. I then returned the favor by digging into her skin. I could feel my arm burning and then it all ended. I evaporated to the front of my house where someone was telling me a story about a girl who ran away. It was like grey balls similar to snow falling from the sky and then I encountered one. I tried to run but couldn't so I gave up then I went back to the driveway. A lot more demons appeared, there was a big boss standing beside demons lined up just shooting guns into no where. Then someone told me the story about a demon girl who ran away. They brought me behind my house and I could see the high heels she left behind, they were red and point at the toe. I then teleported down stairs in the living room and my two aunts and older cousin were there. I then told them about it and informed them that the demons left the garage door and front door open. They told me it was ""Berry B"" or ""Mary j"" I can't remember, and they also told me to look something up as they thought it was that but I forgot it as soon as I actually woke up. I then woke up from it all and just felt weirded out.   
I can steel feel the burning in the spot where she dug her nail into my arm as I am writing this. I went outside to the same spot and it looked like there was a logo drawn into my mother's car but my phone is damaged at the moment. It looked like a greek symbol that went longways and had circles carved into it.   


I forgot to mention before I came into the living room, the boss and the demon ""worker"" were walking out of the house while looking at me. I then yelled out to them ""How can I find you!"" but they just had an evil smile and slightly laughed. I have no Idea what they meant by that when they laughed, unless they are saying they're coming back soon.

I did a quick sketch on the ""Demons"", the ones who tickled my feet and the workers were like little sperms with big heads and a cut out for there eyes. They would float or have legs.

Sleepparalysis,"I never thought this would happen, but it did. I’m 16 years old, and I recently had my first sleep paralysis experience a few weeks ago. It came at random and I’d like to mention I'm healthy and have no sleep disorders, it just came suddenly. I was going to sleep as always, being a school night I had to go to sleep between 9 and 10 PM. Yeah, I have a bit of a bedtime routine but it helps, especially since I do running and need to recharge. I ran that day feeling more tired than usual. Whether that caused it to happen, I don’t know. 

&amp;#x200B;

	Anyways, I proceeded to bed as I always did and stayed up a bit on my phone because I couldn’t sleep. After an hour- hour and a half, of being on my phone, I decided to get some rest and dozed off into sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up at a certain point in the night, I knew it was still night as the room was pitch black, with the charger port light and smoke detector light slightly lighting up the room. Along with the moonlight creeping into the room. I tried moving my arm to pick myself up from laying down, but I couldn’t. I tried to move my toes. Nothing. The position I was in was laying flat and my head was turned to the left, facing my wall but I only saw darkness. The only thing I could move was my eyes. Then I felt something. You know that feeling when you hit your funny bone on something and it feels tingly sharp? That was happening throughout my entire body. I felt a sense of floatiness like I was floating up from my bed levitating mid-air. Suddenly, an image popped into my mind. It was the face of a man with a white background behind him. This might sound stupid, but the man was The Intruder from the Analogue Horror tapes The Mandela Catalouge (I’ll provide the exact image I was thinking of) but the image in my mind was so vivid and real. I then started to feel a sense of impending doom. Like someone was coming to my room and rapidly approaching. I didn’t hear anything but I felt it greatly and I started to freak out. I felt like I was in danger, a feeling that I’ve never felt that much in my life. I closed my eyes, as that was the only thing I could do, and tried to ignore the feeling. It worked for a while and my sense of floatiness went down, but the same image of The Intruder kept popping in my head like that was the only thing I could see but it was in my mind. The feeling of floatiness and the feeling of sharp tingle came back, along with the sense of impending doom. I kept my eyes closed as I was scared and shut them tighter. At this point, I was aware I was in a paralysis and knew I had to be chill and not scared to pass the time. So I told myself subconsciously to be calm and relaxed. It worked and I finally felt my body relax and the feeling of floatiness and tingle disappear. I went back to sleep right after.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up in the morning, and slowly got up. I remembered what happened that night and felt a bit scared and ecstatic. Scared in remembering the entire thing and a bit ecstatic that I experienced sleep paralysis. I told my mother and she agreed it was sleep paralysis. That was my first time experiencing that and knowing how it feels, I’m a bit spooked about what next time will be like.

Sleepparalysis,"Every day for the past week as I’ve been trying to sleep I’ve been stuck in a hallucinogenic state where I can see people and hear voices like children laughing and people whispering around me. I feel like I can choose whether to be awake and in my room or close my eyes and project my mind to somewhere else. I have been fully aware and conscious the whole time. I’m writing this just after experiencing one.

My theory is it’s cold out (-7° as of right now in England) so I have the heating all the way up which causes me to become drowsy and puts me in a sleep paralysis type state. Something logical like that.

Only thing that creeps me out was this time I could hear the whispers more clearly, they were telling me to come back and leave the world behind and stay with them for a while. And they’re becoming more and more familiar, I no longer feel scared, I don’t try to escape, I don’t get jump scared or stress out as much, I just accept it and accept that I don’t know what’s happening.

Please tell me some of you have had the same experiences because after watching that movie about the kid who astral projects and gets possessed, I’m quite scared. I’m not a spiritual person at all, I enjoy philosophy and have been delving into studying Satanism recently which makes this experience and timing even more sinister.

Prior to it happening I had this intense vivid dream where I was a soldier in the trenches and I had all my senses, could feel the cold mud in my boots and the smell of mud and I had his memories , I knew I had a wife and children and why I wanted to serve. Moments after the dream started I was shot 3 times in the chest and I could feel the warm blood fill my coat.

She then placed a bowl of silver water on my chest yet I could still breathe fine. I wasn’t scared as she felt friendly. Then I could feel her grab my wrists and slowly place my fingers into the warm water. The moment my fingertips touched the water. I felt this vibration take over my body so intense it felt as if my soul was being separated from my body. My whole body was tingling and I started to become terrified, like the most scared I’ve been in my life. I started repeating in my head for some reason “if your not of true divine light I don’t want this “ over and over till she looked angry and flipped the bowl over and it floated above me and the warm water dripped all over me , felt like warm rain drops all on my face. The lady on my thighs then flew up through the ceiling and I felt the presence vanish and as it ended I could feel my memories come back like what my name was and where I was and I was able to slowly turn over and I sat up and the light in the room slowly disappeared and I was sitting up and awake startled as that felt so real.

I turned around and looked at whatever was doing this to me, and it was seemingly a normal looking man but his head was completely turned to the side. I grabbed his hand and asked him to look me in the eyes, but he just looked down and didn’t say anything, almost like he was ashamed or crying. That was the last that I saw him, and the humping stopped, at this point I could just feel him holding my arms down.

I started to become uncomfortable with the situation. I was actually calm up until this point, I felt unthreatened by the man, almost as if he was my boyfriend and the drugged feeling was so strong that I couldn’t really tell the difference between him and my boyfriend. When I realized I was uncomfortable, I tried to get up, still on my stomach, but I just couldn’t. My body was so weak and his arms were still gently holding me down. I fought through the feeling because I just wanted to get out of the situation, and the grip of the arms became weaker and weaker. I eventually got up. 

At this point, I was convinced I was awake. I slowly and weakly got out of bed and left my apartment bedroom. When I left my bedroom, I was no longer in my apartment, I was somewhere else. It seemed like I was in the hallway of my childhood house, but the only thing I recognized was my parent’s bedroom door. It was cracked open and I could see the silhouette of a man inside. I tried to talk to him but he shut the door on me. I was about to walk away but suddenly the door opened. 

I went into the room, just to be in an entirely different place again. Something felt really off. It was a very nice house, and I was in a dining room. It seemed as if there was a get-together of some sort going on, but nobody was paying any attention to me. I was telling everyone there that I have no idea how I got there and I didn’t know anyone. Only one person acknowledged me, it was a woman and she looked directly at me and extended her hand for a handshake. I think she was trying to introduce herself to me, but whatever came out of her mouth wasn’t English, hell, it didn’t even sound human. She was the only one who looked at me directly during this whole nightmare, and her face was terrifying, like completely smeared, almost like the famous “The Scream” painting. I didn’t shake her hand, I just continued trying to find a way out/home. Mind you, I still was convinced I was awake. 

I saw a door that looked like an exit, but a man kept blocking it. He was very normal looking, wearing a dress shirt and dress pants, and I only ever saw his profile view. I was shoving him to get through the door frame and saying “excuse me, I need to leave.” He definitely was aware of me and he was blocking me on purpose, but he wouldn’t make eye contact and was pretending like he wasn’t aware of me, he just casually blocked me while carrying on with the social gathering (there was a whole group by the door but he was the only one standing in my way).

I gave up on trying to move him because he wouldn’t budge, and at this point I noticed I was holding a small wooden stake. Out of pure anxiety about the situation, I broke it in half while walking around looking for a way out. Then I was gripping it so hard that it broke skin and was going into my hand. The pain of that is what finally woke me up. 

When I woke up, I felt the stake in my hand still. I immediately turned on my phone flashlight and looked at my hand, which as you can imagine was completely fine. 

If you read through all of this, thank you. 
I have nightmares all the time, but I have never experienced anything like this. It felt real, it felt like I was in a different universe, and it felt like I had actually come into contact with real demons or something.

Sleepparalysis,"So for context, I’ve (26f) had quite a lot of experiences with sleep paralysis my whole life. This morning I had an experience that was like no other. 

So I went to sleep ‘last night’ around roughly 2 am-ish. Woke up this morning around 6:30 am, and thought I’d just try to sleep a little bit longer. Minutes after waking up, laying in bed as I’m trying to fall back asleep, I figured I would get up to get my roommates dog to cuddle bc I was cold and my roomate had left for work already. I got up(or so I thought), walked into my living room, and then walked to get my roommates dog, and then things started glitching and seeming weird and I realized I was in a dream. I tried to wake myself up, and then I did (or so I thought). I “woke up” in my bed again, got up again, and then some other similar version would happen again. I was stuck in this loop. This loop repeated so many times. Sometimes in the loop there would be some random man in the room or house with me. Sometimes I tried to go outside. Sometimes when I realized it was a dream I would take advantage of the lucidity and try to fly. At one point there was an insane visual experience where I went outside my house (while I thought I was awake), and everything looked and seemed incredibly real, and then there was a sudden breaking apart/ anti-gravity moment of my surroundings. All the trees lifted up off the ground and floated around me and the sky almost felt like a multi-sided mirror. It was a crazy way for my perception to go from “I’m thinking this is real” to “I’m guessing this a dream” all while things still looked so real and sharp. 
When I finally actually woke up, it was around 9:30 am and I was exhausted. I know dreams don’t usually last for more than some number of minutes, but this seemed like it may have actually went on for 3 hours.

Sleepparalysis,"My SP dreams are always scary and I always feel desperate to wake up from them and sometimes I hear these sounds outside my room. Like someone walking to the bathroom or washing the dishes. It doesn't make sense that someone's washing the dishes at like 3am but I'm still convinced it's real. It makes me feel even more desperate because the person outside could come help me and wake me up. Eventually I do wake up by myself but to suddenly realise that those sounds were never real feels so disorientating...  
The worst ones are when it's an actual figure standing by my bed and not sounds. I remember a lot of SP dreams where one of my family members walk into my room while I'm hving an episode and I try to beg them to wake me up, but I can't move or talk. All I see is just a dark figure but subconsciously I know if it's either my parents or brother. When I wake up to see the figure suddenly gone it always leaves me so so scared, because it feels like it was someone pretending to be one of my family members.

Sleepparalysis,"I had a sleep paralysis today and saw another me staring at me with the same facial expression and laying down just like me but in another bedroom just like mine, and the world starteg glitching and flickering every half a second or so, in addition to a weird sound playing in the background.

I immediately avoided eye contact with the other me and started to look at the floor that had the carpet that was in another room of the house while the world was glitching more aggressively and the sound volume was increasing  and then I started to resist the paralysis and I read some religious verses when it finally stopped,  I stood up and turned on the lights, and started to think about what happened, it was 6:48 AM.

It felt like a window to an alternative universe has opened to my alternate self and some higher power was desperatly trying to stop the thing.

Sleepparalysis,"You can escape from one  lucid dream if you are able to make contact with other living spirit (e.g family members /friends )

You are likely to be in a cycle if you are not doing things as you were supposed to be. (from experience; was told you werent supposed to do that by someone unseen in another sleep paralysis (cycle)

Changing sleeping direction largely helps in avoiding such dreams.( things being told from long time)

Time remains same as the real world you are in like parallel world .( E.g You saw time was 11:02 in dream , you were able to escape in a moment or short time(with in a min) ..then the time you see will be 11:02 in real world .

The type of paralysis will depend on what is your limit of freedom . In some you are able to move, in some you can just see things(even other people which people call as spirit) without proper consciousness while in some even your movement isnt allowed ( had this one today ; my movement was cancelled with a strangle while speech was resticted with grab/squezze on heart).

The reality and things in both worlds remain as same.

Sleepparalysis,"I have had experiences with sleep paralysis (SP) many times, and a recent experience has me questioning whether or not it was SP or not.   I was traveling and sleeping in a hotel, which always causes some disruptions in sleep.  I was also dealing with a 3 hour time difference, also another cause of sleep disruption for me. 

After a few hours of sleep, I ""woke up"" thinking that someone was standing next to my bed, presumably my boyfriend.   Instead, I thought I was looking at an old woman who was holding a camera.  She was smiling sickly at me and then took a flash picture and was gone.  

The flash was bright and blinded me for a moment.  I felt my body jolt, like a jump scare.  Normally with SP, I can't move, nor can I see the presence.

Sleepparalysis,"Okay so, first time posting here, and obligatory ‘I’m on mobile’ apology; I’m not great with explanations, but I’ll give it a shot. 

So I’ve been having episodes of sleep paralysis on and off for the past decade and a half, 9 times out of 10 it’s when I’m waking not when I drift off- my way of ‘waking fully’ from it has always been focusing on moving my fingers bit by bit til I come round properly, usually works okay, normally takes a while and once I am properly awake I’ll feel fuzzy headed, heavy, etc as expected. A couple months back though, I did my little finger wiggles, but instead of taking time to get out of it, it only took a couple of seconds, but it felt like I was physically being ripped out of it, and it came accompanied with feeling as if my entire room had this violent vibration running through it complete with a sound similar to a massive drill through the wall or something. 

Shrugged it off as a weird wake up but didn’t think much of it beyond being weirdly uncomfortable, like I was still shaken/scared for a good while after. Since then it’s happened 3 more times out of 4 SP wakings. Don’t suppose there’s a reason or a way to avoid it? Or am I just going to have to suck it up as being a new thing to deal with alongside it? I don’t have a clue why, but of all the spooky crap it’s that specific wake up that terrifies me every damn time.

Sleepparalysis,"I've had sleep paralysis before and the first few times it used to scare me. After figuring out how to get myself out of it, on the rare occasions I do get it, the ""dream world"" in the paralysis has just been an exaggerated version of my bedroom with no shadow people. This morning after waking up and going back to sleep several times I got sleep paralysis which is usually how I end up having it. 

Now to start I dream regularly almost everynight and in my dreams faces are never clear to me unless its someone who I see in real life every day. In my dreams I've never seen facial features or even distinctive body features of someone I've never met in real life. And the times I've seen beings in my sleep paralysis it has ALWAYS been shadow people, a dark human shaped silhouette with human dark brown or black eyes and regular looking teeth, nothing with detail.

This morning's sleep paralysis started with me thinking I was actually awake with my husband next to me as we try to fall back to sleep. He began to speak to me and when I went to reply, I just stared back at him and noticed he just looked off. His skin was splotchy and his facial features were so clear but didn't look quite the same. And so I said ""Is that you?....That's not you"" Whoever it was just stared back for a few seconds, I started to feel more unsettled, and then he groped me. I went to turn away and at the corner of my eye I saw something in the shadows. Then it moved and when the person came to view my paralysis started.

This person was moving like how the shadow people i used to see move but I clearly saw his body, his face, hair, what he was wearing. It was a tall probably middle aged black man with a slim model-like physique (long limbs, tapered torso, smaller head, square shaped face). His hair was grey/white and unkempt looking. He was wearing a blue pin stripe vest and trousers with a white long sleeve dress shirt and I think a black tie that was tucked in his vest. His eyes were not human looking, his sclera was almost clear or dark and his iris was a reflective bluish color and I don't believe he had pupils.

He got close to me like the shadow people used to and he sort of bent down to my left side slowly moving in an arch towards my right side while still facing me and his eyes started moving around weirdly almost frantically (like Mayuri from Bleach but a little faster lol) It was like he was searching for something idk. After that I really wanted it to stop so I tried yelling and tried to move my arms which eventually worked.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve been getting about 6 hours sleep every-night and yesterday I had a dream that felt real ( like I felt awake, my eyes were open )but like normally I have nightmares that are very realistic to the point I have a panic attack waking up.
 
But for the first time yesterday I felt like I had my first sleep paralysis, also I’m not good at storys so sorry.

Recently me and my 2 friends had an argument with my 3rd friend due to relationship problems and her being out right rude.

So let’s get started, It was yesterday and I was falling asleep getting ready for college in the morning (it was around 12am) I started drifting off but for some reason my eyes were like open, not fully but still open like I could see around my room but I couldn’t move, but for some reason I was in my imagination because instead of being in my room where I’ve read most of peoples sleep paralysis happening I was I standing infront of my friends house with a pillow and it was raining , I could feel the rain, my friends were coming down the street to go into the friends house I’m infront of, bare in mind It was dark and I couldn’t see them only hear them and they looked like shadows with no faces just shadows  but for some reason they all had voices and the distinct features (such as hair and piercings) that my real friends had so I didn’t think they weren’t my friends that I talk to everyday, they saw me standing outside and told me to come in with a calm tone without asking me why I was there so I kinda realised that it wasn’t real like this is another nightmare because In every nightmare I’ve had I’ve never had a question  from the person in my dreams about what I’m doing or why I’m there , but since I didn’t have control over my actions I went inside the house and when I looked up they were all still shadows so I knew it wasn’t real , I followed them upstairs to my friends room while they were all laughing and giggling like normal , this is where it changed . 
The moment I got in the room I started having blurred vision but I was scared like my body was trying to wake me up but as soon as I said “this isn’t real” while laying front side of my friends bed I felt hands pushing me down and my own voice come from one the shadows while the other two were playing and laughing, I felt like there was a protective barrier around me and the shadow , I physically felt being pushed into the bed and claws being dug into my waist (I still feel the claws in my waist) once the shadow was over me it said “ it’s just like you said , it’s not real and it can’t be real because I want you here , do u understand?” I then managed to turn around to see all the shadows with giant Grins with blood on the teeth they then pushed me into the bed to the point I was suffocating and I eventually was able to open my eyes wider and move my arms so I sat up unable to breathe and my entire body was in pain like I could smell blood, I heard laughter then everything was gone expect for the feeling of pressure on my waist and back.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi all,

I've been having some weird experiences lately and I'm not sure how to categorize them. Usually this will happen to me when I fuck up my sleep schedule by going to bed really late, or wake up and fall back asleep in the middle of the night. I basically have the classic sleep paralysis experience of waking up unable to move. I'm in a dreamlike state. I haven't had major feelings of fear or panic, and usually can recognize what's happening at the time. Not to say it's exactly pleasant, there's definitely a feeling of dread associated with it. I hallucinated a figure standing near my bed once, but I knew it was a hallucination while I was looking at it, so it didn't seem real and I wasn't afraid of it. The weird thing is this: I'll have the impression that I'm fighting the paralysis. Like, I'll be trying to sit up in bed and turn on the light switch or something else that will wake me up fully, and I'll have the impression that I'm actually moving my body, but without enough control to do what I'm trying to do. Once I fully wake up, it's clear to me that I wasn't actually moving at all. Last night I had several ""false awakenings"" where I realized I hadn't been moving, but then started the process over again. This has happened to me four or five times since May, and never before then. I don't really understand how I could be awake and paralyzed but still have the false impression that I'm moving my body, so am I really experiencing sleep paralysis or is this just a weird type of dream I'm having *about* sleep paralysis, since I had heard of it before I started having these experiences?

Sleepparalysis,"I often have false awakening dreams in loop, like 6-7 false awakenings before I truly wake up. I mastered all the things I have to do in order to check if things are real or not. 

Today, I had my very first sleep paralysis. Or I think it was. 
I tried blinking continuously to see who was my ""first demon"" and it was a cat, specifically my cat, with a purple hat, walking towards my night stand on two feet (I even heard her toes tiptaps) like it was nothing (mind you my cat is 20yrsold) and her intention was not bad in any way, she just wanted to turn off the lights because I forgot to turn them off and she sleeps in her tiny bed next to me. Then she noticed I was waking up or blinking because I saw her looking in my direction and freeze to wait for me to close completely my eyes.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello there. This is my first time to write here. So, it was in 2020 when I first experience having sleep paralysis. I remember sleeping but not at the same time. (I didn't know at that time I am experiencing Sleep Paralysis). I just saw pitch black and just hearing MY heart beat. That made me panicked and trying to open my eyes but realizing I can't. After 2 to 5 mins of trying to open my eyes, I finally can. 

That experience made scared but that is not the only time I experience it maybe 3 times in that year alone. 

2nd experience is much scarier to me. As I as sleep ( as usual) I experience it again but the difference is that can see my bedroom. As I was experiencing it, a shadow figure of a woman slowly walked towards me in the side of my bed, which made me panicked. Trying to open my eyes while not panicking. After I open my eyes, in my mind I just hope whatever it is .. is not in my room anymore.

3rd experience. (Sleeping as usual) I was in my room but darker and i saw 2 or 3 shadow figures that are sitting in my bed but facing me backwards. I can also hear them talking about something but I don't  remember.

I'm still frightened and scared when ever I experienced it.

Sleepparalysis,"So my husband and I have been together for over 11 years. In the beginning of our relationship I’ve noticed that my husband was a hard sleeper. There’s been a few nights where my husband will dream about fighting someone and will accidentally smack me in the face or throw an elbow or 2. There has been multiple nights of him even giving full conversation in his sleep. As the years go on the more intense my husbands sleep paralysis becomes. During his most stressful weeks of work it would hit him the hardest. It would start with him sleeping on his back and usually some form of alcohol in his system. He described his dreams as if he was stuck in them. He was aware of him being asleep but he couldn’t wake himself up. Then another night of him constantly waking up but then realizing that he wasn’t actually awake and he would be stuck in a loop (which was the scariest for him) and it would last all night until the sun would come up. 
But there has been 2 particular nights that scare me the most, he falls asleep once again on his back in our bed and he can see him and I like he’s hovering from above watching. In the distance of our hallway he can see a shadow of a figure walking up the stairs coming towards our room. He can sense the being but doesn’t actually see it. Another time the shadow made it to our room and stood next to my husband and watched him sleep for what he said felt like hours.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello everyone! 

I’ve experienced sleep paralysis since I was a child, probably 7/8 years old. I’m currently 25 years old. So its been bothering me my whole life. Sometimes I have sleep paralysis every night, and sometimes it takes weeks before it happens again. I’ve talked to my therapist about it and he told me that my sleep paralysis is induced by fear. He recommended that I confront my fear the next time I got sleep paralysis, which was this morning. The following is a description of what I experienced. Please do not read if easily disturbed. 

It was a man with a leather mask covering most of its face. You could only see his eyes and mouth. His eyes were yellow and he had his tongue out flickering side to side. I woke up with sleep paralysis and heard it come out of the closet and staring at me. He started laughing maniacally. It was really scary but I remembered what my therapist said, not be afraid and to confront my fear. So I stared at it back and realized that it couldn’t hurt me. So I started telling it that I wasn’t scared of it, and then it started laughing even harder and scarier! But I didn’t look away or close my eyes I just said again “I’m literally staring at you, I’m not scared of you” and he got super super close to my face, I literally felt its breath on me and then I was able to move around. 

This helped me not feel as scared to go back to sleep as I usually feel, and I didn’t experience sleep paralysis the rest of the morning. I hope this keeps helping me in the future and I hope you guys can confront it and also feel safer.

Sleepparalysis,"I am sensible. Maybe more sensible than other people.

Anyway, sometimes movies trigger me and although I love watching movies, they affect me.

I decided to watch Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities last night, episode 1. Amazing, it not only shows the dark paranomal but also the dark nature of mankind. But there was this scene with a summoned entity with no face. Its face was darker than the darkness of the room. Pure void.

I saw this in my sleep paralysis episodes when I was younger and seeing it consciously in detail, it affected me. I know how it is, I felt it. Writing this now started to make my hands shudder :( Ehem, I went to sleep last night and managed to relax. But I had trouble sleeping, I just kept waiting to fall asleep. It was so quiet also, no sounds from my cat, no sounds from outside, no cars, no radiator, no neighbours, nothing. 

But, after a long time I heard it. It’s that sound. It’s as if something heavy steps on the floor one time and in the same time the floor subtly pops. Honestly, I laughed it off thinking “Haha, all this silence and now this familiar paranormal sound. What if it’s 3:33 am exactly…”. I grab my phone to look at the clock and its 3:33am. Incredibly amused and horrified is an understatement. I kept my eyes open and started praying until I felt ok and I heard nothing more. 

I am no longer “haunted” by sleep paralysis so much and I moved away from the occult exactly because of this. In my experience and analysis, I’ve had sleep paralysis in my darker heavy depressed times (remember the word heavy) that I mixed with the occult. But I have not already understood how those sounds keep happening iRL before I experience it. 

The sounds, let me explain. When I was younger and had a lot of sleep paralysis… at night when I was starting to fall asleep, I would hear a faint pop + heavy press either in the floor, wall or furniture. HONESTLY, I took it rationally. Let’s say the interior of the room subtly cracks and pops from inside because of heat difference between day and night. OK. Then why my mother that would sleep in another room with same furniture, same wall, same floor, same window/light going in room, HAD NO SOUNDS AT NIGHT? I tested it. Anyway, it got so bad that I could literally feel the heavy presence in the room, literally causing things to pop and press on heavy. Recognize what I say? Heavy? You know when in sleep paralysis you feel something heavy on you? Bingo. But also so big - make it noticeable in reality. Heavy press on things. I moved from the room one night, I was horrified. I still remember, I mentally said “Stop it”, and in the next second i heard the loudest heavy pop press ABOVE MY HEAD. I ran to my mother’s room and slept with her. It was ok the first 1-2 days but then the same sounds happened for a while there. Mom heard it too and believed me. It stopped when I moved to the other room, but I would still wake up EVERY NIGHT around 3am. Just wake up. No sounds, no more sleep paralysis. That also stopped after some time.

What I want to say, I am a bit shocked that I still heard that sound last night, after suuuuch a long time.

In my sleep paralysis experiences, I could see something darker than the darkness from my room laying on me heavy. Sometimes it pressed hard on my arms and I woke up with small point form bruises. I am not religious, but that was the only time I prayed and it worked to wake me up.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi, I really hope this reaches someone.

I am a 19 yr female, very experienced lucid dreamer, and I am very advanced in working with the subconscious mind, through manifestation and shifting states/realites. Basically, I am very in tune with my mind. 

I was always interested in lucid dreams, learned how to do them, but I haven't actually started randomly getting them until recently. Every nap I take during the day, basically turns into a lucid dream, all unintentionally, so I am pretty experienced with being able to identify whether or not I am dreaming. The thing with lucid dreams, is that they feel incredibly real and vivid, like you are actually living the dream out. 

the first time I had this absolutely terrifying experience was 6 months ago, I was lucid in the dream without realizing it actually was a dream, and I kept looping (like changing dreams or ""waking up"") I finally woke up to my bedroom, but it was super off, things were changed and different, I had this mirror in front of my bed that I looked into, and my whole body went paralyzed, my eyes were bright red and rolled to the back of my head, I couldn't speak and I could barely move at all, the most unbearable thing was the pain, its that same pain every single time, its a pain like everything in my body is about to burst, I really cannot describe it, I was trying to call for help, but I eventually snapped out of it and woke up. 

I will only mention the most notable experiences even though there has been plenty, one of the next few times, I ""awoke"" from my dream into my bed again but this time my room was much darker in light then when I fell asleep, I sat up, felt the paralyzed feeling again, eyes roll to the back of my head, feels like im going deaf, then I look to the floor. There is a black goat laying on the floor of my room, I somehow manage to get over to it, and I literally start making these scary scary noises like almost speaking tongues until I finally snap awake again. I want to mention during this time period, I also heard a voice in my head that wasnt mine, it was terrifying. It was a deep males voice, and all it said was ""GO THE F\*CK TO SLEEP\* I almost started crying when I heard it, and tbh I wanna cry right now just thinking about it. 

the next experience was like two months later, prob a month ago from now. I started my dream lucid, and my dream was me texting my friend group chat in bed. everything was the same besides the fact that it was raining and then all of a sudden it started again, my body went paralyzed, this time I didn't react, I wanted to see what happened if I just let it happen, and I kid you not, I started fucking gliding fast as hell off the bed, slammed into my closet, then dragged upside down against my door, all while being unable to move. it was absolutely TERRIFYING (I honestly thought I could have been astral projecting) 

the most recent attack happened 20 minutes ago, and it was my scariest one yet. It happened like 4 times in a row. All the dreams were dark and gross and twisted, but everytime I had that paralyzed feeling, I was always in my bed with something off, like different decorations etc. This time I literally saw a presence at the corner of my eye it was like covered with a white sheet. I couldn't move and the pain was so incredibly real. I tried to call for help many times. Every time I started to move again. I slowly slipped back into being paralyzed . Its a terrible feeling being unable to move. I tried praying, I tried letting it happen, and nothing. I just kept ""waking up"" then falling back into until I finally woke up for real. I also wanna mention, I was listening to my affirmations I recorded to fall asleep, And they were playing the whole time but all distorted, the only one that I made out was ""i...god"". Does anyone know wtf I am experiencing??? its scarring the absolute crap out of me.

Sleepparalysis,"I had experienced sleep paralysis for the first time last night. It was horrible and really scary. I felt myself being pulled up from my bed and as soon as I realized I was dreaming, my body fell back onto my bed. I knew I could control it, and that I shouldn’t be afraid, so I started to float myself back up. Somehow I ended up at the edge of my bed and rolled off it, falling to the floor. I was filled with relief when I *thought* it was over, I got back in bed and went to sleep. Then I wake up to realize I hadn’t even moved an inch, and the whole falling off the bed thing had never even really happened.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi, this is has been going on on and off for years and it’s gotten to a point where I am super worried about it and I feel like I may even die in my sleep. The way it starts off is I slowly slip into right before my body is about to wake up from a sleep. It feels heavy and as I try to get myself out of it before I fully lock in my head starts to nod (almost like a seizure???) but I don’t believe it’s a seizes. Either way I’m conscious, I can hear everything going on around me but I can’t see anything, I can’t open my eyes I can’t move my body at all (not even my toes) the only thing I can do it breath and sometimes moan or groan which has helped me in the past to get my boyfriend to wake me up from it. I can hear myself screaming at people to get me up from it but it’s just a dream, my boyfriend can’t actually hear me. My brain feels heavy and my body does and I never know how long it last but when I wake up I feel like I ran a marathon or I got into a fight. My entire body aches and my head hurts and I feel so burnt out. This is the part that worries me the most.

Sleepparalysis,"I was sleeping on my couch sideways. I felt some""one"" press up against my back, causing just enough pressure to have the impression that it was harder to breathe. I suspected a sleep paralysis demon, but knowing about them, I kept my cool and decided to just go with it, and make myself comfortable.

So the sleep paralysis demon starts spooning me (I'm the little spoon) and then he puts his arm around me. The arm is a dark leathery/carapace texture, but to avoid panicking, I begin stroking his arm lovingly. In the partial dream state, his arm seems to go on forever, as does mine, as I don't have to do a back-and-forth motion. Our never-ending arms just lets me go on forever.

Then I woke up. I hope he's doing okay. :)

Note: I usually have sleep paralysis during daytime naps, so I usually never see sleep paralysis demons. I expect because they aren't able to hide in any shadows.

Sleepparalysis,"Drank too much Friday night. Just woke up to a SP episode. I could tell or sense Bella hadid in demon form was outside heading straight to my place. My fear really started to escalate as I hear her footsteps directly outside my apartment. Then she placed her hand on my door to get inside. At this point I try to move but of course am completely frozen. The words “don’t come in” were stuck in my throat. The terror that overcame me when I hear my code being punched in and unlocked was indescribable. Thankfully I woke up before I had to see her face to face. 

Every time I see Bella hadid now I’m going to think of her with a black sunken face wearing ripped clothes hanging off her skeletal figure breaking into my apt. *shutters*

I actually stumbled upon this stuff on reddit after googling some SP questions at 4am after a *wakemare* lol i realised theres not enough out there about the spiritual side we all know we are experiencing, its not just scientific and physical like the official explanation says. \n\nThis is going to be a long one sorry.\n\nIl start with my childhood experiences, first SP i had i was falling asleep and could hear a ringing(always a ringing for me) and like a build up of energy so strong then bam im para and the ringing/energy in my body was overpowering from my feett up to my head, around the same time i saw a shadow figure move back onto the wall as if hes been caught. I ran to my mums room and explained what happen, the next morning she sat me down with our lodger at the time, cool colombian dude, and she said she wanted me to talk with him about what happen and left us to it. Long story short he told me about SP but how at night there is a small tiny window when dimensions can be seen/felt/crossed. He told me of some of his experiences and how he felt magic mushrooms either made it happen more or made him understand it more i cant remember that part, this was years ago. Even tho he didnt get scientific, he gave me the first clue that has always stayed with me, tiny window at night time when dimensions can be crossed.\n\n Cool moving forward, i had more SP over the years nothing really changed apart from me being terrified and thinking wtf lol. Then one day i tell my step mom whats happening and she basically said it was demons and told me a small verse from the bible to say when they attack. She claimed to been attacked before in her sleep by a winged beast and she managed to turn on the light and see it was a female demon, whats fucked up is her 2 daughters, my half sisters, was in the bedroom and they said they all saw it too and heard its noises. Even creepier is my half sister then told me she later in life also had a visit at night from a spirit who asked her for water, she said the next day she put a glass of water by her bed at night before sleep, then the next morning no nightmares or visits but the glass of water was half empty and moved position. Anyway i thought that was wild but then one night SP happen really really intense scared the shit out of me couldnt wiggle or kick out,  i remembered the bible verse and said it in my head...woosshhhh.. it vanished but i never felt it vanish like that before or since. It was litrelly like someone getting off from me instead of me getting up out of a struggle, theres a difference when they WANT to get off your body instead of being fought off, i felt it, i knew then in that moment GOD is real and because the bible verse included Jesus name i knew that name, be a real person or a mantra of our higher selfs, its real and whatever these SP demon things are, they dont like it! Buttttt... it only worked that 1 time never again, i dont know why but i can only be honest and tell you what i experienced and felt. A few weeks later i was watching a doc on alien abductions and one of the lead scientist on the subject began being upducted right when he was really getting into his research on the phenomena. He described SP up untill the point he is taken onto the ships. He even calls it SP and describes it word for word how we in this forum experience. He was athiest but in one alien/SP attack he was so scared and desperate he called Jesus and Gods name for the first time in his life..gues what happen? They placed him back in bed and vanished instantly, and he too recalls it being so different from coming out of previous attacks. At the moment i knew in my heart this stuff is much deeper than science. The scientist became a christian btw lol il try find his name maybe someone on here can recongnise the doc or his story. But yeah the puzzle was starting to build up, windows of dimensions, aliens, demons, angels, jesus, religion-spitituallity- the unknown. Etc.\n\nThe next section is going to be a mash up of 10years and up to the point im at now this morning at 5.50am writting on reddit after my latest SP attack. I really got into the law of attraction which open me to the world of chakras energy etc. When you manifest £100k+ just like how the secret said it would, you too would want to dig further! And that i did, i studied the occult and joined a group of Santeria followers for a while, google it if you dont know. I began becoming obsessesed with both spirituality/occult and psychology and bought alot of books to read. Now if you saw me in person you would never associate me with those topics, im not a vegan, im not claiming to be a witch on IG and giving out horoscope readings etc. I became soley obsessed with the science of the phenomena i was experiencing with energy work, SP, manifestatiom etc. Its real btw manifestatiom it works, but only if you BELIEVE it to cos your perception/expectation litrelly echos and morphs the metaphysical(scientific fact). So anyway i came to a point to understand that your brain waves are the fishing hooks for the ""otherside"". When we sleep there is a window inbetween being awake and being unconcious, our brain waves hit a certain frequency that just clicks with that ""otherside"" it has a scientific name i cant be bothered to google right now but its a sweet spot between theta beta alpha omega i cant remember what they called but look into it lol yh that sweet spot is real, thats the window the colombian dude was talking about. Thats the gateway of how the aliens was abducting the scientist in his SP. During my time studying the occult and practicing with the Santeros, that sweet spot is where you need to go to do the astral work, like projection, looking into other places in the world physically. On many occasions i would take a nap at home and just before falling asleep id feel the vibrations of SP but new experiences, no more struggle and nightmare i could now either lucid dream in my own imagination or i could kind of astral project and look out onto the street through walls and just look around. So yeah i know that sweet spots real there is a window into another world or another dimension of this world i should say. I still had bad SP attacks after but very rare and i less scary, one i would never forget was in Belize i had a blocked ear so i used drops and it made my ear ring (exactly how a SP attack starts for me!) Then later i had a nap and SP happen in a hotel room, i could hear Belizian ancestors talking in their dilect and a women being angry that i came uninvited, it was the eardrops fault not mine lol. I also had really positive experiences, like during one meditation i reached the sweet spot and felt these weird vibrations colours ears ringing and i saw a white male in black suit i got the impression he was a doctor, everything in the background was green but his image was in black and white, and he then dissapeared and i felt my long sholder pain from an injury had also dissapeared with him, thanks doc. Later on in life i went into a depression due to stress at work and my childs mother, this lead onto really really bad diagnosis of OCD and not the cute counting cleaning type, this was the worse type of OCD where you are constantly bombarded with intrusive thoughts and vivid images of the worse possible acts and sceanes the human species is capable of..this lasted 2 years and anyone reading who also suffers from OCD..i know how you feel and trust me YOU WILL BEAT OCD THAT SHIT AINT REAL AND YOUR GOING TO BE LAUGHING ABOUT IT ONE DAY! But yeah through battling OCD i learned about ERP which basically means triggering yourself and not doing anything about it so your brain calms itself down. Only makes sense to those with OCD lol but basically one of my biggest obsessions was that somehow im going to get really stoned one day and a demon is going to contact me and ask me to s*crafice my ch*ld and i would somehow develope schizophrenia and believe voices in my head and go crazy bla bla bla. The ERP homework was to go to my deepest darkest place in my mind, that place im afraid of, and just sit there untill it litrellly dont scare you and you give zero fucks. And that i did, i smoked alot of weed closed my eyes and took myself to my deepest darkest nightmare and made it as real and alive as i could make my mind do so. I went there. The only way i can describe it is i died while stood alive and i didnt care what happened. I felt asif my soul was being burnt from the inside out . Mentally there was alot fire scary demony stuff, your typical, i remember little deamons crawling on the floor like monkeys and me bitch slapping them and laughing at them calling them lil bitch saying this dont scare me il piss on your home. I closed my eyes and remained in this place, then gradually it just faded away, all that worry was gone all that care and obsessiom was gone. My body on the otherhand was filled with terror i was shivering and couldnt sleep properly for 2 weeks the pain on my neck was crazy the stress chemicals was ripping my body that night but mentally i felt rebooted almost. I had this sense of being reborn, like my body went to its max and then kinda just restarted? I had to mention this so i could say the next part. After doing ERP for OCD, my negative SP attacks will now be faceless, no more figures or monsters or anything visually scary, but the energy remains evil. I know when im having a good visitor and evil visitor cos ive felt them both. Now the evil SP attacks are faceless but i stare at its pure energy, its presense is still there and the same.  I genuinly believe these evil pressences are real and we are the ones who creat its face, its body its voice. Fuelled by our fears and anxiety. Cos it was from ERP my subconcious became empty of fear that i now dont have a fear to attach to that energy when it comes. Ive been prison in real life, ive been prison in my own mind, i have very little to fear or call a boogeyman thats why i believe now my SP attacks are formless and just its pure energy, and also i usually just wait it out and try stay positive while the SPs happen now i even try channel the physical vibration more and welcome it. But tonight something weird happen, i had a formless SP attack and i was winning by being positive and facing it straight on, sometimes like tonight i say things like ""what lil bitch you think your going to scare me in my own home i got god in my veins BRING IT HAHAHA IM SO FUCKING SCARED etc"" but as i was winning tonight i had my eyes open, i saw my nose being physically pinched and then i couldnt breath. That wasnt a hallucination i saw and then instantly felt my nostrals closing and no air being available to me. It looked like when you have a blocked nose and you try breath air in hard and ur nose gets stuck and sunk into your face, yeah i saw that tonight during SP and i dont have a blocked nose! Thats the reason i was googling at 4am and found this reddit. Thats never happen to me before, anything really really physical on this dimension being touched by the out. It scared the shit out of me. \n\nThis shit is far deeper than we know, my advice is look into ERP to take the scary characters/forms away. But the true answers are in the meditation/energy world they know that sweet spot very well, we are falling into that sweet spot by accident and those evil fuckers are waiting to prank you becuase you dont know whats happening and your scared. Fuck that shit, in your next SP try to act as brave and warriorlike and ready as possible, trust me you will be suprised. Some of you reading this may feel scared and dont want to believe ghost stories are real, pull your socks up wake up and smell the coffee, we aint got a clue about this planet dimension or even our bodies for that matter.

I actually stumbled upon this stuff on reddit after googling some SP questions at 4am after a &lt;em&gt;wakemare&lt;/em&gt; lol i realised theres not enough out there about the spiritual side we all know we are experiencing, its not just scientific and physical like the official explanation says. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a long one sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Il start with my childhood experiences, first SP i had i was falling asleep and could hear a ringing(always a ringing for me) and like a build up of energy so strong then bam im para and the ringing/energy in my body was overpowering from my feett up to my head, around the same time i saw a shadow figure move back onto the wall as if hes been caught. I ran to my mums room and explained what happen, the next morning she sat me down with our lodger at the time, cool colombian dude, and she said she wanted me to talk with him about what happen and left us to it. Long story short he told me about SP but how at night there is a small tiny window when dimensions can be seen/felt/crossed. He told me of some of his experiences and how he felt magic mushrooms either made it happen more or made him understand it more i cant remember that part, this was years ago. Even tho he didnt get scientific, he gave me the first clue that has always stayed with me, tiny window at night time when dimensions can be crossed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cool moving forward, i had more SP over the years nothing really changed apart from me being terrified and thinking wtf lol. Then one day i tell my step mom whats happening and she basically said it was demons and told me a small verse from the bible to say when they attack. She claimed to been attacked before in her sleep by a winged beast and she managed to turn on the light and see it was a female demon, whats fucked up is her 2 daughters, my half sisters, was in the bedroom and they said they all saw it too and heard its noises. Even creepier is my half sister then told me she later in life also had a visit at night from a spirit who asked her for water, she said the next day she put a glass of water by her bed at night before sleep, then the next morning no nightmares or visits but the glass of water was half empty and moved position. Anyway i thought that was wild but then one night SP happen really really intense scared the shit out of me couldnt wiggle or kick out,  i remembered the bible verse and said it in my head...woosshhhh.. it vanished but i never felt it vanish like that before or since. It was litrelly like someone getting off from me instead of me getting up out of a struggle, theres a difference when they WANT to get off your body instead of being fought off, i felt it, i knew then in that moment GOD is real and because the bible verse included Jesus name i knew that name, be a real person or a mantra of our higher selfs, its real and whatever these SP demon things are, they dont like it! Buttttt... it only worked that 1 time never again, i dont know why but i can only be honest and tell you what i experienced and felt. A few weeks later i was watching a doc on alien abductions and one of the lead scientist on the subject began being upducted right when he was really getting into his research on the phenomena. He described SP up untill the point he is taken onto the ships. He even calls it SP and describes it word for word how we in this forum experience. He was athiest but in one alien/SP attack he was so scared and desperate he called Jesus and Gods name for the first time in his life..gues what happen? They placed him back in bed and vanished instantly, and he too recalls it being so different from coming out of previous attacks. At the moment i knew in my heart this stuff is much deeper than science. The scientist became a christian btw lol il try find his name maybe someone on here can recongnise the doc or his story. But yeah the puzzle was starting to build up, windows of dimensions, aliens, demons, angels, jesus, religion-spitituallity- the unknown. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next section is going to be a mash up of 10years and up to the point im at now this morning at 5.50am writting on reddit after my latest SP attack. I really got into the law of attraction which open me to the world of chakras energy etc. When you manifest £100k+ just like how the secret said it would, you too would want to dig further! And that i did, i studied the occult and joined a group of Santeria followers for a while, google it if you dont know. I began becoming obsessesed with both spirituality/occult and psychology and bought alot of books to read. Now if you saw me in person you would never associate me with those topics, im not a vegan, im not claiming to be a witch on IG and giving out horoscope readings etc. I became soley obsessed with the science of the phenomena i was experiencing with energy work, SP, manifestatiom etc. Its real btw manifestatiom it works, but only if you BELIEVE it to cos your perception/expectation litrelly echos and morphs the metaphysical(scientific fact). So anyway i came to a point to understand that your brain waves are the fishing hooks for the &amp;quot;otherside&amp;quot;. When we sleep there is a window inbetween being awake and being unconcious, our brain waves hit a certain frequency that just clicks with that &amp;quot;otherside&amp;quot; it has a scientific name i cant be bothered to google right now but its a sweet spot between theta beta alpha omega i cant remember what they called but look into it lol yh that sweet spot is real, thats the window the colombian dude was talking about. Thats the gateway of how the aliens was abducting the scientist in his SP. During my time studying the occult and practicing with the Santeros, that sweet spot is where you need to go to do the astral work, like projection, looking into other places in the world physically. On many occasions i would take a nap at home and just before falling asleep id feel the vibrations of SP but new experiences, no more struggle and nightmare i could now either lucid dream in my own imagination or i could kind of astral project and look out onto the street through walls and just look around. So yeah i know that sweet spots real there is a window into another world or another dimension of this world i should say. I still had bad SP attacks after but very rare and i less scary, one i would never forget was in Belize i had a blocked ear so i used drops and it made my ear ring (exactly how a SP attack starts for me!) Then later i had a nap and SP happen in a hotel room, i could hear Belizian ancestors talking in their dilect and a women being angry that i came uninvited, it was the eardrops fault not mine lol. I also had really positive experiences, like during one meditation i reached the sweet spot and felt these weird vibrations colours ears ringing and i saw a white male in black suit i got the impression he was a doctor, everything in the background was green but his image was in black and white, and he then dissapeared and i felt my long sholder pain from an injury had also dissapeared with him, thanks doc. Later on in life i went into a depression due to stress at work and my childs mother, this lead onto really really bad diagnosis of OCD and not the cute counting cleaning type, this was the worse type of OCD where you are constantly bombarded with intrusive thoughts and vivid images of the worse possible acts and sceanes the human species is capable of..this lasted 2 years and anyone reading who also suffers from OCD..i know how you feel and trust me YOU WILL BEAT OCD THAT SHIT AINT REAL AND YOUR GOING TO BE LAUGHING ABOUT IT ONE DAY! But yeah through battling OCD i learned about ERP which basically means triggering yourself and not doing anything about it so your brain calms itself down. Only makes sense to those with OCD lol but basically one of my biggest obsessions was that somehow im going to get really stoned one day and a demon is going to contact me and ask me to s&lt;em&gt;crafice my ch&lt;/em&gt;ld and i would somehow develope schizophrenia and believe voices in my head and go crazy bla bla bla. The ERP homework was to go to my deepest darkest place in my mind, that place im afraid of, and just sit there untill it litrellly dont scare you and you give zero fucks. And that i did, i smoked alot of weed closed my eyes and took myself to my deepest darkest nightmare and made it as real and alive as i could make my mind do so. I went there. The only way i can describe it is i died while stood alive and i didnt care what happened. I felt asif my soul was being burnt from the inside out . Mentally there was alot fire scary demony stuff, your typical, i remember little deamons crawling on the floor like monkeys and me bitch slapping them and laughing at them calling them lil bitch saying this dont scare me il piss on your home. I closed my eyes and remained in this place, then gradually it just faded away, all that worry was gone all that care and obsessiom was gone. My body on the otherhand was filled with terror i was shivering and couldnt sleep properly for 2 weeks the pain on my neck was crazy the stress chemicals was ripping my body that night but mentally i felt rebooted almost. I had this sense of being reborn, like my body went to its max and then kinda just restarted? I had to mention this so i could say the next part. After doing ERP for OCD, my negative SP attacks will now be faceless, no more figures or monsters or anything visually scary, but the energy remains evil. I know when im having a good visitor and evil visitor cos ive felt them both. Now the evil SP attacks are faceless but i stare at its pure energy, its presense is still there and the same.  I genuinly believe these evil pressences are real and we are the ones who creat its face, its body its voice. Fuelled by our fears and anxiety. Cos it was from ERP my subconcious became empty of fear that i now dont have a fear to attach to that energy when it comes. Ive been prison in real life, ive been prison in my own mind, i have very little to fear or call a boogeyman thats why i believe now my SP attacks are formless and just its pure energy, and also i usually just wait it out and try stay positive while the SPs happen now i even try channel the physical vibration more and welcome it. But tonight something weird happen, i had a formless SP attack and i was winning by being positive and facing it straight on, sometimes like tonight i say things like &amp;quot;what lil bitch you think your going to scare me in my own home i got god in my veins BRING IT HAHAHA IM SO FUCKING SCARED etc&amp;quot; but as i was winning tonight i had my eyes open, i saw my nose being physically pinched and then i couldnt breath. That wasnt a hallucination i saw and then instantly felt my nostrals closing and no air being available to me. It looked like when you have a blocked nose and you try breath air in hard and ur nose gets stuck and sunk into your face, yeah i saw that tonight during SP and i dont have a blocked nose! Thats the reason i was googling at 4am and found this reddit. Thats never happen to me before, anything really really physical on this dimension being touched by the out. It scared the shit out of me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This shit is far deeper than we know, my advice is look into ERP to take the scary characters/forms away. But the true answers are in the meditation/energy world they know that sweet spot very well, we are falling into that sweet spot by accident and those evil fuckers are waiting to prank you becuase you dont know whats happening and your scared. Fuck that shit, in your next SP try to act as brave and warriorlike and ready as possible, trust me you will be suprised. Some of you reading this may feel scared and dont want to believe ghost stories are real, pull your socks up wake up and smell the coffee, we aint got a clue about this planet dimension or even our bodies for that matter. Fuck science and general accepted knowledge  according to official records one side of the planet just found out about the other side 500 years ago and we made to believe we now know everything about this billion+ year old place? Fuck science and everything you believe in that makes u feel seperate from the unknown, we live in the unknown we was born here this is our home.

When I’m in it, I also feel like there’s a constant current of electricity running through me. I also feel like, during sleep paralysis, I’m more in tune with my body though I can’t move.

Sleepparalysis,"Last night, I had lots to drink at a club. I got so wasted, my friends helped and drove me home. I woke up in the afternoon feeling nauseous, then I cleaned myself up a bit and went back to sleep. I had a really long sleep, and I remembered my dream was bright and happy. Lots of laughter with friends and family, and even mixed with characters from the video games I’ve played before I went partying. 

The Sleep Paralysis Event
While I was on deep sleep, I remembered in my dream where out of nowhere, I was in my house all of a sudden and my sister told me they were waiting for me to get home. Adjacent from our Kitchen is the Den Room, where they managed to clean up and all the lights were on. [I real life, don’t use that room since it became like a huge stock room for my mother’s stuff] I started to become suspicious and when I looked at my sister, she grabbed my hand and told me to come with her to that Den Room. I was hesitant and asked her why, and she told me my parents are waiting there for me. [At this point, I remembered in real life when someone we knew died in their sleep without any cause as to how that happened, my mom, being superstitious, told us to never accept invitations from people in your dream, as it might possibly lead you to your death] I refused to go with her, and when I blinked, all of a sudden I was back in my bed facing the ceiling, and everything was dark and gloomy. I felt this presence, someone was pinning me down. 

It was an image of a woman I never knew, her face was pitch black but I can see her hair strands from my point of view. She somehow is standing or crouching on top of my bed’s headboard. I saw her hands, it looked dirty and rotten, and she was grabbing me by my chest. Her grip was too tight and my shirt was getting wrinkled by it, I couldn’t move or stand up. I knew I was now in a limbo, as I had past experiences with open-eyed dreams but this moment is by far my worst. I then hear an echo, my sister’s voice saying to come with her as my parents were waiting. This paralysis demon then started to laugh in a sinister sound, her laughter had that echo as well as if she was mocking me, using my sister as bait. I tried to scream but I I didn’t create noise, moved my arms and fingers to snap myself out of it, and tried blinking repeatedly until I saw her jump off my bed and ran where I can’t see her. I still can’t move and I can hear footsteps and her sinister laugh. My whole body feels like I’m tied to my bed with a rope, and I couldn’t wake up until I tried to shout “Lord!” at the top of my lungs. I’m sure I was panicking alot since this was the closest I’ve seen my sleep paralysis demon, and so much more aggressive than my past sleep paralysis episodes. When I screamed, everything got quiet, and the vignetted point of view started to die down. I took a long breathe, closed my eyes, and finally woke up from that dream. 

This sleep paralysis demon felt like it wanted me dead. From my previous sleep paralysis episodes, I always see a dark shadow the shape of a tall woman always lurking at the corner of my room. There are times where I got used to it, and not feel scared about it since I knew it wouldn’t hurt me. One thing is common though, its always a sinister woman I’ve never met thats tormenting me every time I experience sleep paralysis. The second worst experience I’ve had was when I felt like I was being dragged by this dark entity, grabbing me by my legs as it continues to pull me towards the darkest areas. The night before that, I had ate a lot and went to sleep right after. [According to my mother, eating alot and then going to bed right after can sometimes trigger a sleep paralysis event] I’m just glad that I’m still alive because of my mother’s superstitious advice, and because I knew there is this voice in my head that tells me what to do and saves me all the time.",t2_5bt1j3js,0,I finally saw my Sleep Paralysis Demon,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,zin3vr,True,tachunkachan,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zin3vr/i_finally_saw_my_sleep_paralysis_demon/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/zin3vr/i_finally_saw_my_sleep_paralysis_demon/,53266.0,1670753866,0,,False,1670753880,1670753880,2022-12-11 10:17:46,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"Lately I have been having more audible sleep paralysis hallucinations. One recently still has me wondering if it was real or sleep paralysis. For context: I sleep with a white noise, Bluetooth sleep mask. 

The other night around 3am (I could see the digital clock on the wall under the slit below the bottom of my sleep mask) I heard what sounded like animal screeching noises. I *think* I lifted the mask to listen closer and I *thought* I heard my fiancé get up from bed to check it out. When I felt the bed rustle again I said “did you get up”. I *think* I heard him mumble something but I was exhausted and fell back asleep. 

A few minutes later I was woken up again by the sound of happy baby screeching. No babies live in my house, and my house is about 3 acres away from any other houses. I listen again thinking the house is haunted. Once again I think I ask my fiancé if he hears it. I just hear him ask me to sleep and hug our dog. I reply “I’m too tired” and start to fall asleep

Then in my sleep mask clear as day. I hear static and what sounds like someone tuning an old radio. Then I hear a male voice saying “Stay out of my baby’s room, I repeat, stay out of my baby’s room. Do you copy? Can you repeat that back to me?”  I try to reply but I can’t talk as I’m in full sleep paralysis. 

A few minutes later I’m able to break out and I take my mask off and turn it off and back on to reconnect it to my phone. My sleep mask does have a microphone so if for some reason I did connect to a baby monitor and I was sleep talking then they could hear me on the other side. However, my fiancé says he never spoke to me or got up at night at all.

Sleepparalysis,"I just need to get something off my chest. My friends are really nice and empathetic, but they don't experience sleep paralysis as frequently as I do. 

I've been really overworked and stressed out for the last couple of months. A couple of weeks ago I decided to cancel a project - now I'm free from dec - feb. It feels really good. I'm going to rest, exercise, do nothinggggg and examine my tendencies to work too much. 

This has been my first week off, and the sleep paralysis has been there everyyyyy night. I know that for me heat is a big trigger - it's really cold outside so I fall asleep with two blankets and then I get the nightmares. But I can also imagine it's stress-release related. 

Two nights ago, in a dream, I relived something that upset me greatly. My mother died in 2013 of cancer, and I relived the moment that I saw her dead body for the first time. I hated it. It felt so real. And I wanted to wake up, to snap out of it. 

Did anyone else ever relive a traumatic experience in a sleep paralysis dream? (of course I don't mean to pry and don't need to know about all of your traumas in detail, just if you've ever experienced the same thing) 

Well, I just needed to tell that so people that might understand what I've gone through. I already feel a bit better, taking the time in writing this down.

Sleepparalysis," I just woke up from being ticked for what felt like eternity. I know it sounds weird, but hear me out. 
  I have had a lot of sleep paralysis dreams throughout my life, some of them more freaky then others. Most all of them scary/ disturbing to an extent. But this dream was just odd. 
  At first it was a normal dream, me and my gf exploring the outdoors of Arizona for a bit. All a sudden in the dream, I'm on my back and she is leaning over me, tickling me. Not a normal tickle, a very irritating non stop tickle against my will. My gf started pressing down on my belly button, which is an irritating feeling to me in general, but then she started to wriggle her finger sternly into my belly button. I started telling her to stop, I did not like it, but it persisted. So I tried my best to pull her hand away from me, but no matter what I couldn't get her to stop. 
  After what felt like a long, annoying tickle torture, I woke up gasping. She was sleeping right next to me, and I was on my side, nothing was weighing me down. But I noticed my stomach growling intensely. 
Usually I stay up a little after a paralysis dream to avoid going into a continued sleep paralysis, or different version of it. So I decided to post about it on reddit. 
  I've noticed I've had a different set of strange dreams since I moved in with her. Welp... so that's it.

It can be frightening to just keep your eyes closed and relax if you feel like someone is in there with you, but I know it will be much worse if I try to fight it or open my eyes. If I do, I will hear loud screaming and static pressure which gets tighter and tighter the more I fight it.

Sleepparalysis,"I always had sleep paralysis, especially when stressed or depressed. I guess in general whenever I change my sleeping patterns there are more chances I will get an episode. I am a very skeptical person, so I don’t really believe in entities or demons.

I had many sleep paralysis episodes in the past. Some were traumatic, of sexual nature, but very vivid. What all had in common is that it was always the same sort of male/demon energy. 

What I find interesting is that not long ago I came out as bisexual, and I had an experience with a girl in real life…so well recently I had another sleep paralysis episode and this time it was also a sexual experience, but it felt like a female/demon energy…

Sleepparalysis,"SP? Idk! 

I want to preface by saying I do suffer from anxiety and my anxiety is also much worse when I’m drinking. I drank heavily last night before falling asleep.

I kept waking up multiple times throughout the night and my mind was just racing but with all very random and very vivid thoughts and images. 

Then, at around 5 am, I’m suddenly “awoken” but I felt unconscious and there seemed to be a couple bright flashes of light in my mind that felt so real. I couldn’t move but then I suddenly could. But when I could move it felt like I was jerking. Probably trying to force myself out of it? It honestly all happened SO quick but I was overwhelmed with fear and honestly it almost felt like a seizure to me? I’ve never had a seizure that I’m aware of. After doing some research I’m thinking it could have been SP, which is obviously better than having a seizure. But right after this happened, I was wide awake and couldn’t fall back asleep.

Sleepparalysis,This happens when I was about 13. It was a school day and I’m tired as all hell. About 45 minutes later I’m almost out cold but my mom barges in to grab something and she forgot to close my closet and the whole night I felt something watching me then I woke up to this pale unseeable creature in my closet. It slithers out and it’s my mom but she has the body of some abomination I can’t even describe it. The thing crawls up onto my bed and starts staring at me it rears up still looking at me and then the face changes it smiles tearing it’s cheeks it’s teeth Razor  the eyes fall out of their sockets. After this thing mutilates it’s face it gets off my bed then it just stares for about a minute before it’s neck snaps and the head is upside down then it dashes under my bed and then I can move again. I  was so scared I couldn’t scream then I felt something in my sheets and it was warm.

Sleepparalysis,"I (21M) have been experiencing SP for several years at this point. It comes and it goes. I always have it at least a couple times a week, but sometimes (like right now, causing me to make this post) I have episodes where it will happen several times a night for several weeks in a row. It gets to the point where I am afraid to sleep at night, knowing it's going to happen and there's nothing I can do to prevent it.

At what point should someone consider medication or stuff like that? I don't want any of that, but it's to the point where I feel anxious throughout the day about going to bed at night and I don't sleep well at night anymore.

Sleepparalysis,"Ok so this is my first time experiencing anything like this, and only found out about this subreddit by googling ""getting fucked by a ghost"", so please bare with me, this is my first post too so hopefully I get this right! 

TL;DR : got fingered by something I couldnt see, it was daytime, I had my eyes opened and didnt feel scared or paralyzed (it actually felt good!) so the only explanation I got during that moment was that I was being fucked by a ghost, but google redirected me towards possible sleep paralysis experience? (Never had SP before!)

Long version, here goes: I woke up around 5am this morning and tried going back to sleep for hours but couldn't, instead I layed there on my side, thinking. At some point, I feel my boyfriend (who was sleeping behind me), slide his hand on my stomach and start making his way down there. I opened my eyes (it was bright in the room as the sun was up), and reached for my phone and saw it was 7h30, I then felt his hand slide down and start stimulating me. It felt good and I was really into it, I put my hand on his and could feel his hand under mine. Now where things got weird, is I turned my head back to look at him, and he was sleeping, with both hands visible on him, but I could still feel the hand going down on me ?!? 

At that point I'm super confused, but also still super turned on by the stimulation, the invisible hand kept going and started penetrating me both ways, and its super skilled 😅. I really started wondering what was going on, and tried to makes sense of it (dozen ideas popped in my head, none making sense). Then I felt a second hand slide fingers in my mouth as the first hand is still doing its thing. I know this is weirdddd, but I was actually having a good time, it felt amazing and I didnt want it to stop, but my mind was still racing and trying to make sense of it all.

So I turned my head again to double check on my boyfriend, but that confirmed he's still sleeping, with both hands visible. I pinched the tip of one of the invisible fingers, and at that point I thought wtfff, am I being fingered by a ghost?!? Started thinking about who it was and why, and that started creeping me out, and the sensations started fading away and ended. 

So apparently ""ghost sex"" isnt anything new according to Google, and its been reported for thousands of years, they now think its linked to SP. I've been reading through this thread and I see people refering to not being able to move during SP and feeling a choking sensation, but I didnt experience any of those things, did anyone experience something similar to what I lived ?! I'm feeling so weirded out by the whole thing, just trying to make sense out of it.

My eyes kind of creeped open and I felt this vibrating all through my body, but especially my head. I also heard this buzzing that covered all background noise. I didn’t see anything this time (Thank God), but I felt this pressure on my chest slowly building up. It started to slowly build up and feel like it was crushing me, and that’s when I realized I was in a paralysis. I focused on moving my arm, and ended up breaking out of it and throwing my arm up in the air. Not a terrible episode, but I’m disappointed I had an episode after almost a year of not having them.

I sleep on my stomach and I thought that I woke up but when I seemingly opened my eyes there was a dark figure standing over me and in front of the window next to my bed.

I did the classic “oh creepy dark figure, that’s cool…OH WAIT A MINUTE, you’re not supposed to be here” and tried to figure it out.

Sleepparalysis,"Bear with me here, I had a severe episode last night and I’m not sure if it was a night terror or sleep paralysis because it doesn’t quite fit into either category.

It was the first time I’ve ever had something like this happen to me so I’m a little lost here.

I won’t got into all the details, but the short version is that I woke up laying in bed looking at the ceiling with an intense feeling of dread and anxiety. I knew something was wrong, so I sat up. I looked to my right, saw something horrifying, gasped loudly in terror, waking my boyfriend up. Then I quickly turned my head to the left, saw the same disturbing thing but inches from my face, and screamed and started crying hysterically.

By the time I saw the second thing, my boyfriend was fully awake and holding me while I cried. He could attest that I was fully awake and lucid when I saw what I did. There were also no breaks in my memory/perception from when I saw the things to when I was being held and firmly awake.

From what I’ve researched about night terrors, they’re essentially REALLY bad dreams that cause severe panic attacks while you’re asleep. And that they happen exclusively when you’re asleep and usually aren’t remembered or are fuzzy upon waking.

What I experienced sounds a lot more like sleep paralysis. I have a vivid, perfectly clear memory of everything and was definitely awake when I saw what I did. The only thing that’s tripping me up is that I was actively moving.

I don’t believe in the paranormal, so I’m trying to figure out what exactly I experienced. Has anyone experienced anything like this before?

Sleepparalysis,"I had a pretty strange SP episode.  
I’ve had SP episodes before including ones that felt very demonic and scary but today’s episode was pretty distinct. I’ll give a little context cause i’m afraid someone is targetting me with witchcraft.

I recently had an altercation with my neighbor at a party at my home. It was pretty bad and she changed some parts of the argument to put it on social media hoping i would get cancelled. I called her the next morning and yelled at her then decided to just outright ignore her. A lot of people in the friend group sided with me knowing actually what happened. She has not been around all weekend.
From the basic context ill go ahead and speak about the dream. It started as a regular dream and we were having a party again at my house. Then the lady we had argued with pops up behind me, angrily tells me something like “you will feel pain”(not verbatum). Hits me on the head. Now im laying on the couch, this is where i slept, and the SP episode is full on. I can feel something trying to crush me/pull my palm open and i am trying as hard as possible to resist. I start levitating from the couch as the struggle continues seeing myself leave my body. Im saying mental prayers and trying my hardest to say my prayer out loud. I win the struggle and im back on the couch. Now i can see a shadowy figure moving next to me on the couch, and a visual of a white figure moving towards me. After the white figure pretty much reaches my face they disappear and i think i am awake. But my eyes are super sleepy. I dont want to go back to sleep so i try my best to keep my eyes open. At that point i wake up and i can tell i am fully back awake(no more inception). Im pretty terrified at this point but i am okay. I look at my doorway and i think i saw a whitish figure peeking at me from the other room im thr dark. They see me seeing them and pull back into the other rome. I move quickly to the other room and turn on the lights but find nothing/no one. All the doors are closed. Im hoping it was a hypnogogic hallucination but i am really scared.

I want to sleep after a tiring day and instead I am locked in bed awake seeing scary ass shit while being immersed in terror! Does this sound like a blessing you fuck??? 😂 But hear me out I have never gotten sleep paralysis naturally although as a kid I would get what's called night terrors which can be significantly worse. I have gotten sleep paralysis 3 times by using techniques that cause it. I know it can be scary but sleep paralysis is the perfect state to go into a WILD (that's a LD technique) lucid dreaming by turning attention inwards or having an astral projection by turning attention outwards. Most people freak out get paranoid they can't move and then start seeing some very distressing stuff. But for people like me who love to explore conciussness every sleep paralysis is a gift delivered after only very hard work.

Sleepparalysis,"Heyo. I have developed tinnitus a few months ago and recently, it started to affect my sleep. This is a very strange form of tinnitus, leaving the constant ""eeeeee"" aside.

Very often, at the end of a dream, there is this phenomenon, that appears suddenly:

[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lBAPTBzWcLM](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lBAPTBzWcLM)

&amp;#x200B;

(used [https://www.checkhearing.org/tinnitusmatching.php](https://www.checkhearing.org/tinnitusmatching.php) to create it)

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as this begins, I can feel my body in my bed (still dreaming) and I am unable to move my limbs anymore. With every passing second, the sound's volume increases, to the point where it gets unbearable. If I dare to even try to move my body, the sound grows exponentially, so I just have to wait it out. This whole thing can last from seconds to several minutes, which can feel like an eternity. To make it even worse, while this event happens, my brain is trying to associate it with something scary like getting stabbed, creating horror figures, etc.

After this, I am usually sent in another dream (false awakening), where I am desperately asking my family for help, feeling high levels of anxiety. Then, I finally wake up. I'm still able to hear that pattern of tinnitus, but it's like ten times less deafening.

If I'm trying to go back to sleep immediately, the whole process repeats, ending up in a loop. To avoid this, I skip a sleep cycle (1:30h-2h).

&amp;#x200B;

Sleepparalysis,"The weirdest thing just happened to me. So I woke up with sleep paralysis about a couple hours ago. I then fell asleep and repeated the cycle of going to sleep and waking up again with sleep paralysis a couple times. After about the third time though, I was awake after having broken out of the previous paralysis, and I was on my way to falling asleep again. I was in a sort of semi-conscious state. Before I could fully fall asleep though, my whole body received a sort of jolt as if I was electrified, and then following that I couldn't move my body at all. It was like I was hit with a paralysis beam out of a sci-fi movie or something. This sudden jolt of my entire body immediately brought me to full consciousness.

Sleepparalysis,"It used to affect me more in 8th grade because I would be scared of falling asleep but now it's pretty much a normal occurrence. Like others, it happens the most when I'm stressed and on my back.

During sp, I get auditory hallucinations where I usually hear someone screaming in my head.

I have to actively try to get myself out of sp bc if I don't, it feels like I'm gonna float away from my body. It's a weird sensation that I can't withstand for a long period of time.

Sleepparalysis,"I just want to share my experience, I'm not looking for tips because I've tried everything, it's just unpredictable and it happens at any time.

My episodes of paralysis, in 95% of cases are like this:

- I can't open my eyes, everything is dark, but I am aware of my surroundings.
- I start to have difficulty breathing, my breathing stops being automatic and becomes completely manual.
- I start to feel scared and anxious for no specific reason and I start to hyperventilate.
- I desperately want to wake up because I feel too tired to keep breathing in and out, I can hear my noisy breathing.
- If for some reason I manage to wake up, I am in a drowsy state, I can barely open my eyes and I feel almost deathly fatigued.
- I feel like I'm falling asleep again, when I don't want to, I don't want to go back to sleep, I want to jump out of bed and move so I don't experience the paralysis again.
- If I go back to sleep, start small cycles of the same, but a little shorter, until in one of them I manage to wake up, but more tired than when I started sleeping.

Usually this happens to me once a week lately, sometimes twice, there were periods when I didn't have a paralysis in months and I felt like I was cured, but no, here they are, and I never got used to it.

Sleepparalysis,"I was raped by a sex demon in my sleep every night starting at around age 18 to 25, and again recently (age 28) which is what caused me to write this post. Prior to age 18, as in all through out my childhood, I’d have nonsexual encounters with either the same demon or a different one. I can’t be sure. There’s a lot to say but I was hoping to find someone who’s been through something similar. I still get easily spooked alone at night and usually sleep with a light on.

I posted in this sub because I know there’s a strong possibility this is all just sleep paralysis and not anything paranormal. However, it is terrifying and each encounter has felt very, very real with a sense of a lingering presence long after awakening from my slumber.

I guess I should add the details of these encounters, although they are traumatic to recount. Without getting into too much detail, what usually has happened is that I would be asleep but could see my room, from different angles all at once. I could feel a cold bony figure penetrating me vaginally and I could feel it’s tongue on and inside my vagina as well. I could feel it’s tongue forcing it’s way into my mouth at the same time and it would pin me down using cold hands. My wrists would feel pinned down. This would go on for a few mins or longer but almost always I would try to scream and no sound would come out. Not being able to move or scream is what led me to believe this was all sleep paralysis but as the years went on, the figure kept returning and it would always feel so gruesome - like my worst nightmare. As I would awaken, the demon would grunt or scream, almost as if it was expressing its dissatisfaction.

It sounds funny, but during a sleep paralysis episode, I would just start to shake my head back and forth, over and over and over until I was finally able to wake up. Of course, when I would wake up, my head wasn't moving from side to side, but that's how I was able to escape a sleep paralysis episode.

Sleepparalysis,"
I've been told from another sub I've posted this on that this is sleep paralysis and to check this sub out but I just want to double check on it being sleep paralysis since when I have this dream I'm able to move around. I've been having a recurring dream since about 6-7 and have had again recently. The dream is of me in my bedroom. Usually I'm alone but in the most recent one I've had 2 of the cats that live in my house with me. There's this odd sensation that something is off and that someone is watching me. Sometimes if I look at the window there will be a figure at it just staring in. This build up of psychological dread will be happening for a good few minutes. There will be a shadow at my bedroom door due to the landing light being on. I either will be on the landing or still in my bedroom but they all end the same. This figure will appear and stab me in the chest and start to twist the knife. I will be getting stabbed for a minimum of 10 seconds before waking up.

Sleepparalysis,"It was the first time I’ve had sleep paralysis. To cut it short I was having a random lucid dream and towards the end of it this is what happened. I was in a foreign to me place, I remember some guy saying ‘we’re way up north’ and I went outside to check out where I was and what was going on. In an instant I’m walking towards a wall to which I saw a leg poking out,(as if a person was lay upright). So naturally knowing it’s a dream and well who gives a fuck I walk up to said wall and then in an instant I felt immense pressure and a beautiful face, but with those dead white emerge staring deep into me.(In said moment I wasn’t scared more so startled, I was just taken aback by her beauty) within a few seconds I had opened my eyes irl and I still saw her for maybe 2/3 seconds until then she starts corroding and a deep abyss of I guess terror emerged.

During this time I felt strong pressure on my whole body and I was unable to breathe. Once I was able to catch a breath I snapped out of the trans and the moment was over with. The thing is, not for a second during that time was I frightened, even when the girl was corroding away in front of me I was still able to see her eyes looking deep into me. The only reason I wanted to move my arm just to try and grab ahold of her, I was just that mesmerised by her. I guess this sounds pretty weird but I actually want another occurrence like this to happen, just to be able to get a clearer view of her once again. During the day I tried my very best to keep onto the image of her face in my mind but as time went on the image faded and faded but I guess it's how it works with such hallucinations.

But yeah I mean all in all just a brief story I guess of my sleep paralysis experience

Well since this initially got deleted due to lack of word minimum I'll give a brief summary of my life the past few months and maybe as to why I was so calm about the whole experience. I've almost completly secluded myself from my friends and basically have no contact with my family(I live in sweden right now and they're in the uk) The main reason for doing so it due to trying to fight off my co dependency and allow for myself to live with myself and not need an emotional crutch in others around me or partners to a full extent to how I may have previously have been. In the last 2 months I've been having nothing but nightmares, from killing done by me and to me, weird unexplainable feelings of unease during 'normal' dreams, and generally I've been full of anxiety more than ever in the last 7 years of my life. Leading back to nightmares, I've never been particularly scared of them just because I have the mental block of oh it's my imagination, everything is made up and not real. But that still didn't stop me from feeling un easy after some nightmares, like when walking past mirrors for example. However the last 2-3 weeks I've become so use to them I just don't even get fazed anymore. But with that said is my reaction to the whole sleep paralysis 'normal' so to speak. In the sense of that I'm even keen on chasing that sensation again just because of how surreal the experience was even if it has such an evil connotation due to the nature of hallucinations, struggling to breathe and immobility and yet it made me feel good right after and like I said stunned by the face of the girl I saw rather than afraid.",t2_11vnx0,0,My sleep paralysis demon was beautiful,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,za1zks,True,maciejpro3vo,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/za1zks/my_sleep_paralysis_demon_was_beautiful/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/za1zks/my_sleep_paralysis_demon_was_beautiful/,53119.0,1669933367,0,,False,1669933378,1669991283,2022-12-01 22:22:47,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"Technically I don't know if I actually experienced sleep paralysis, the first time was around 19 age, college break, I was home and my parents didn't care about my schedule. I started sleeping like crazy, like 14-16 hours a day, you know when you sleep too much, you get more and more groggy and sleepy. It may be due to lack of oxygen or other reasons.

Anyway, one afternoon when I was at home getting ready for bed, and I was almost falling asleep, I suddenly felt someone spying on me at the door of my bedroom. And then the feeling came, I thought about it for the first time, but I couldn't do it, and then I felt like I couldn't move, but my heart was beating like crazy, and my ears were buzzing. As soon as I resist, or try to yell, it gets serious and I feel like I'm dying. I was terrified and thought it was a heart attack. Until a few minutes later, I woke up, searched the Internet, and found that it was probably called a sleep paralysis.

But then things got weird, like I found my way into it. Whenever I'm extremely tired, before bed, I can control it: First feel your own heartbeat, then sink your consciousness down, think about a trigger, such as someone staring at you somewhere, and then it starts.

I'm starting to find the paralysis enjoyable  beyond description. I found out that a lot of people in this sub like it because it feels like they are floating on a cloud, and I just like the feeling of my heart beating fast and the blood rushing through my ears. It was almost like sexual pleasure, but something different.

So, I want to communicate with you guys, is this normal. I've never drank or smoked before, but I've recently started having a few drinks because life is getting tough and I'm worried that my addiction to the sleep paralysis is going to kill me, or give me a real heart attack?",t2_tcn3wj50,0,The Sleep Paralysis Experience and...Pleasure?,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,z9p4zi,True,GreenDiary_Lime,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/z9p4zi/the_sleep_paralysis_experience_andpleasure/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/z9p4zi/the_sleep_paralysis_experience_andpleasure/,53118.0,1669904626,0,,False,1669904648,1669991164,2022-12-01 14:23:46,,,,,,,,,

I focused on trying to move and speak for a little bit and kept on thinking about it until I finally was able to. I ended up sitting up really fast and panicking a little even though I didn't feel super panicked when I couldn't move. 

I was thinking that it was weird since I've never had sleep paralysis before but I was reading posts in this sub and now I think I might have? 

When I was a child I had a reoccurring dream that my back was being poked by some creature with long nails and I could feel it but couldn't see it. Once I woke up I could still feel it poking me for some time. I couldn't move but I had never really thought of it was sleep paralysis.

I've also had some dreams where I've been ""trapped"" in my bed while my mind is trying to get up, like I've gotten up and started getting ready but then ended up still in my bed, and when this would happen it would happen at least twice in a row.

Are those instances also sleep paralysis?

Sleepparalysis,"It starts when I was dreaming of playing video games, then it felt like I was half awake. Demon appears pouring in my bed like a viscous slime. It looks like big cat with a smol human face and red lips, kinda looks like Poppy from poppy play time. I usually sleep lights off.

It kinda sounds like I'm lying but manage to give him a single whack. As soon as I seen him standing I immediately felt an artificial fear, that was when I knew I'm in sleep paralysis. My body starts getting heavy like my arms are wrapped by chains while under water.

I closed my eyes as soon  as my fear starts growing, he comes closer and felt the ot touch my hands. It was weird ot felt like a cats fluffy tail. I grab the tail quickly pull it closer and whack it out of existence.

I still feel weird after waking up. The feeling of fear like it was forced into me. Sounds like a joke but I don't know how I did it.

Maybe because I bound myself in my own fear. Like I'm so afraid of wasp and them big ass bees TF. I'll like bolt half a mile if I saw one, bees here are like 2-3 inches long OH GAWD.

That would be all. Oh and I was some black dried up stuff in my right hand when I pulled the sleep paralysis, it smells like coffee probably coffee. I drank coffee before I sleep.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi! This is my first time ever posting to this subreddit, and I didn't really know where to put this experience. I know we don't know each other, but the first time I told this to someone, I was kind of called crazy for it, not gonna lie, that kinda hurt, especially when I told this to someone close. However, I have a feeling that you guys might understand a little better.

So a little bit of a background, I take antipsychotic medications and antidepressants to manage bipolar symptoms, I know its really important to be consistent, but depression has been very difficult alongside keeping a normal sleeping routine. So for the past week, I have been skipping meds since I keep forgetting to take them, and I dont know if this is a cause of my medications or something else, but I had my very first sleep paralysis, but I dont if that's even it.

But the experiences was more weird than terrifying than what others say. So I 'woke up' in this dream, I couldn't move, but somehow I could speak? Anyways, I saw this thing walk by my bed, confused, I said, ""hello?"", the thing looked at me just as confused as I was, it even looked around before looking back at me.

Essentially it was like that spider man meme pointing at each other, almost like I wasn't supposed to be seeing this thing. I dont know why, but it just ran off and disappeared. So I verbally said, ""Okay, well I'm going back to 'sleep'. So I tried, but all of a sudden couldn't breathe, like something was sitting on my chest. Then I screamed, ""Let me sleep!"", and then it stopped.

Sleepparalysis,"I am new here and I am sorry for every mistake in advance, but I just need help. 


As said in the title, every goddamn night I try to sleep, I experience a sleep paralysis episode.
At first I have thought of it as regular nightmares, but after experiencing it for 3 days straight I know that's it's not that. 

I'm on day.. 8 now, 9 maybe and its just getting worse and worse. I have experienced sleep paralysis before, but they were just minor flashes of images, now it's entire sounds and moving hallucinations.
It started with whispers and movement in the dark just before I drifted off to sleep. Now it is mostly whispering voices and what sounds and feels like small animals running over me, most commonly on my head but sometimes my chest and legs too.

The worst so far was a full on paralysis where I heard the audible sound of people walking through my room, moving stuff and my bed just being in the middle of the room with everything happening around me. Then my eyes were just forced open and there was a door that definitely wasn't there before, in it standing a figure i can't describe. It got so bad that I cried out in tears for my dad to look around the room if there were people there and me going to bed with a knife because I was just too afraid.


I have just awoken from another failed attempt at sleep, after I heard and felt yet another small animal run across my face and around my head. I don't know why but it's awful, torturous and I must've screamed loud enough for my neighbours to hear me because we got a distressed call from them.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi guys, 

I have had sleep paralysis since I was a young child. And it comes and goes still at age 24. I am female, and noticed last night I had several episodes and they were pretty bad. I havent had any this bad in a while

Let me explain what i mean. 

I find most often I wake up in SP I am on my stomach with my face in my pillow, I can’t tell if my chest/nostrils are also paralyzed or if its almost a panic attack, but I can’t breathe or lift my head out of the pillow to breathe. It is very scary and each time it happens I feel like I am going to suffocate, so I try to remind myself to wiggle my fingers or toes and stay calm, however I had the same episode about 4 times last night. 

I read that it isnt common to have SP while on your stomach, and am wondering if this is possibly something else. Or if any of you have experienced this same feeling of being suffocated by your pillow unable to lift your head or rotate it to breathe? 

It just really scared me last night since it has not been this bad for a while and I was very anxious when I woke up.

Sleepparalysis,"Hey so just on a whim I typed in sleep paralysis to the search bar and of course there is a community for this very specific thing on Reddit.

I’m 32/m and I’ve experienced sleep paralysis for probably over a decade (not sure when it started but definitely in my 20s)

I experience SP often.. but sometimes I go months without it happening.  

Below I will list everything I think contributes to my SP and also anything I think will resonate with others who experience this weird ass thing.

Also, I really want people to communicate with me if any of this resonates with you.

- sleeping on my back is almost 100% when SP occurs.. I have no fucking idea why.. is it because the brain fluids are in the back of brain because of gravity and that some how had some thing to do with it?  This is pretty much the most important thing I know about SP and why it happens..  I’ve had it happen while sleeping on my side.. it’s very rare but I remember it has happened a few times.

I don’t see any weird demon shit or whatever people talk about with someone holding them down..  I know people experience this but personally I’ve never felt any weird entity holding me down..  just inability to move my body.

for me it just feels like I suddenly become conscious and I know I’m not in a dream anymore and I can’t move my limbs and it feels like I can’t breathe even though I am breathing.

When I realize I’m in that SP state I immediately start trying to move my limbs.. like as hard as I possibly can and while I’m in that state I can feel myself wiggling my legs and arms.  It’s hard to say if I’m actually moving my limbs but I swear.. while it’s happening it feels like I’m moving.. lately when it happens I feel like I’m getting better at battling the SP and I’ve legit been able to bend my knee to where my foot is flat on the bed and my knee is bent.. 

I take OTC sleep aids pretty frequently.   Not sure if this has much to do with SP but I just wanna let people know my experience..  I take Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and I also take Doxylamine.. not together but I switch off between the two.. pretty much every night.. not in high doses.

I’ve been prescribed Adderall and other ADHD meds since I was in 1st grade.. not sure if that info is important but thought I’d share if possibly it resonates with someone.  I haven’t taken any stimulants for over 2 years but I still get SP.

I drink a lot.. alcohol makes me sleep and I tend to drink in order to fall asleep..  I think alcohol has something to do with SP..  but also I’ve had SP many times without alcohol.. but I thought it was worth mentioning.

When I’m in a SP state I remember it very well.. I’m all of sudden aware that I’m not in a dream and I’m also not awake but desperately trying to become awake.. when I eventually get out of SP it’s like I go from pure panic and fear of not being able to move my body.. to being conscious and completely calm but also aware that I was just experiencing this crazy fucked up thing just a second earlier.

Anyways I just wanted to post this incase anyone might resonate with my experiences.  I know there is other things I wanna say but can’t think of every thing right now.

Sleepparalysis,"20M here

For the past 6 years, I’ve had sleep paralysis on &amp; off.

When I get it, I GET IT.

Last night, I woke myself out of sleep paralysis &amp; every single time I tried going back to bed I’d get it again. This went on for about an hour, hour and half.

I’d be asleep for a bit, and I’d wake up terrified trying to get myself out of it while hearing loud ass noises &amp; thinking I would die. I don’t see any demons, or clowns or anything. I just can’t move, feel like my heart is racing &amp; that if I don’t get out of it, I’ll die.

This happens to me at random. Maybe every two months or so? But last night it happened about 8x until I was able to go to bed.

Does anyone else experience similar, intense &amp; frequent sleep paralysis episodes? Everyone of my friends only gets it once &amp; can go back to bed no problem.

Sleepparalysis,"This has happened to me twice now, both within the last 6 months or so. It’s this weird cyclical dream and/or sleep paralysis, but I can’t find anything on it on the internet so wondering if anyone here has experienced it. Apologies in advance for the rambling I’m finding it really hard to describe. 

Both were when I was falling asleep (or maybe had fallen asleep?) but basically I fall asleep then wake up in the same place &amp; position and when I “wake up” — or feel like I’ve woken up — I can’t move and try to get up. Sometimes I “succeed” at getting up, but it feels like I’m walking through molasses, then wake up and I haven’t moved, I’m still in the same place/position and am stuck. Sometimes I can’t get up and then fall back asleep, only to wake up in the same place and same position again. This will happen 10+ times in a row per occurrence. 

Examples: Last night in one of the cycles I called my boyfriend on my phone but couldn’t get any words out; I was trying to say “help” but it was just “h-h-h”. The next cycle I realized I hadn’t actually succeeded at calling him and was still stuck there. Another cycle I made it downstairs wrapped in a blanket and his whole family was down there (they had left the day before), then “woke up” again — I still don’t know if I am actually waking up or if I’m dreaming about waking up, but either way when I do I’m stuck. A few times I’ve been stuck and felt like someone sat down on the bed, but no one is there. Again, each cycle of me trying to get up and sometimes “succeeding” and sometimes just staying stuck, happens about 10+ times before i actually wake up for real. 

Both times I’ve eventually been able to get up after going through the same scary cycle over and over and over again, but it takes me a minute to figure out if it’s real or if it’s just another cycle.

Sleepparalysis,"I just had my first sp last night. I don’t know how to describe it other than scary. It didn’t last for too long and I didn’t have any major hallucinations but there was this one thing that happened that I was wondering about. I remember waking up and moving for one second. All I did was turn over and then that’s when it happened. Everything went numb and I couldn’t move. I remember hearing what was sounded as though a man was trying to get in but couldn’t because my door was locked. Is it normal to be able to move right before? I’m greatful I was able to because I feel as though it saved me from a lot of ther scarier hallucinations that could have happened because I ended up facing toward the wall. If I have one are they more likely to start reoccuring? Is there anyway to prevent them? If this happens again how do I cope with it because I ended up not being able to fall back asleep as my mind started racing thinking the man was in the room just watching me, waiting for me to move(This part wasn’t apart of my sp but was the part afterward).

Sleepparalysis,"  

I first began experiencing sleep paralysis in my mid-twenties. I was living in a condo with my then SO, feeling neglected as he had been sleeping on the couch more and more, and I was also working a pretty stressful job in retail management.

My first experience was absolutely terrifying! While lying on my back I could feel my blanket slowly being dragged off of me…

It hit me then that I couldn’t move. I could feel myself being dragged off my bed, around my room, and back to my bed. The figure then pulled me to the edge of the bed and began having sex with me. And this continued as I was carried around my room straddling the figure. It was certainly demonic in appearance with deep red flesh, a large scowling face, and rough dark hair that had horns poking out. The body was an impressive and intimidating muscular build like that of a massive body builder. 

I came out of this experience completely questioning how my boyfriend didn’t hear any of this taking place just down the hall. It felt real. I was terrified of that figure. Then a few days later, he came back and the whole process started again. Only this time I understood this presence was actually trying to please me. This continued on for several months and I both craved and looked forward to these nights. I was horrified that I was either actually entertaining a demonic presence or that I was so stressed and so lonely my mind might just be conjuring these experiences up. The sleep paralysis demon would visit me one more time, only now it was a different figure. This being was quite small in stature and was giving creepy vibes. It appeared at my bedside and just stared at me with a huge grin on its mottled face. Then the visits would come to a blinding halt when I moved out a year later.

It would be years later before I ever heard someone reference a sleep paralysis demon experience that I would truly understand what had previously been happening to me. I shrugged it off and went on about life and never told anyone because I felt like a dang weirdo. 

It was several years later that the experience would come back, only it was different this time. I lost my dad on my wedding anniversary quickly and very unexpectedly. It was incredibly hard to adjust to life without him being a phone call or text away. He was just shy of seeing my son walk for the first time on his own. So many firsts went by without him. Then a couple months later my brother came over to have dinner and to see his daughter before bed (she was temporarily living with me). He was so excited to come see her that night and we had a blast taking pics with funny filters. He then said he had to get going because he was selling his bike the next day and needed to get home. I fell asleep and woke up to my mom hysterical on the phone. She said my brother was hit on his motorcycle and she was on her way to the accident and she didn’t think she could do this, but she also knew she had to know. I told her it couldn’t be him. He had just left my house 15 minutes ago. As it turns out, it was him. Some asshole with a suspended license got into a car that he didn’t own and made a left turn and cut my brother off. He spent a month in hospital with ups and downs. He amazed me with how strong he was, how quickly his body healed, how positive he remained. My family and I prayed over him every visit. Just when things were looking up, we lost him just like that. 

This was living a never ending nightmare. We weren’t given the chance to grieve or mourn in any proper way. We were thrown into a weeks long struggle trying to raise funds to hold his funeral service. Not to mention I had a completely unsupportive husband at home shaming me at every turn for the time I spent visiting my brother at the hospital, shaming me for helping my mom financially so that she could try to grieve and not need to worry about yet another thing after now losing two of her sons. 

Fast forward a few months. My marriage was rocky before I lost dad and my brother, but now I was certain it was over. I wouldn’t spend my life with a person that can’t hold me through my most pain filled months. I am now living alone with my son in my home and the sleep paralysis has returned. 

This time it is much more terrifying. There is nothing sensual or interesting about it. I still feel my blankets being dragged off of me. I am slowly pulled from my bed by my legs or almost like the sheet beneath me is being pulled. Sometimes I am dragged around my room. Other times I am lifted or floated up above the bed and suspended. Every time a figure gets close I can feel pressure not directly on my body, but I feel the bed sink in and it feels as though the blanket is being pressed taut against my body to hold me down. The figures I see are always varying in features. 

One was a very slim tall and pale man approaching me from my open closet. The next was extremely tall and full in its build. As it approached the bed from my open bedroom door it bent down over me on the bed, only its limbs weren’t quite right. They seemed to bend in the way an insects do. I had such a hard time when this started happening again that it took forever to fall back to sleep. There have been nights where I wake up out of it, just to fall back to sleep and have it happen all over again. I have become quite good at waking myself out of it by repeatedly telling myself to WAKE UP, WAKE UP, WAKE UP! 

I know I veered off there for a bit with that personal story, but I believe it is all connected. This has only ever occurred during times of high stress, and there hasn’t been any higher stress in my life than I have had this entire year.

Sleepparalysis,"it feels a little weird going to reddit for any kind of medical advice, but im not really sure what else to do at this point. im 18 and for the past 2 years I've been pretty miserable. not going to elaborate much, but its mosly due to dealing with ocd, psychosis, depression and adhd. im posting here though because ive been dealing with a lot of sleep issues. i was originally diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis / PANDAS, but recently have been told that was a misdiagnosis, although i don't know who to believe. anyways, for the past year ive been having sleep paralysis very frequently, like 30-50% of nights. it usually happens a few nights in a row and then stops for a few days, and then repeats. it also usually happens early in the morning and is usually really upsetting. i hallucinate every time i have sleep paralysis and they are usually frightening and often traumatizing. they can be tactile, visual, and auditory and are usually a combination of a few of these, and are usually intense and vivid enough that i genuinely fear that i am going to die when it happens. i can elaborate more on the content of the hallucinations if it's important, but i dont think it is so ill stop here. i get really shitty sleep most nights and the hallucinations often fuck up how i feel the rest of the day. i also am really tired most days and for a while couldnt stay awake at school, but i started getting more sleep recently so its less of an issue now. two other things worth noting is that i dream as soon as i fall asleep and most of my dreams are lucid dreams, although i rarely have much control over them. the nightmares and the hypnagogic hallucinations have become very stressful, and I've been referred to a sleep specialist, but the appointment is in like 6 months. all the doctors ive talked to so far have been useless and I've gotten nowhere in the past 2 years. im also on an antipsychotic called geodon and have been worried that it might be making it worse becuase it affects my sleep a lot. so im coming here in case anybody has any thoughts or advice they wanna share. if anyone wants more info id be happy to share. ive sorta documented all the different hallucinations ive experienced and have a good understanding of them, i just dont know why i have them in the first place.",t2_i410o1o1,0,"i have sleep paralysis a lot, looking for answers",[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,z5pdn6,True,dgmarie0001,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/z5pdn6/i_have_sleep_paralysis_a_lot_looking_for_answers/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/z5pdn6/i_have_sleep_paralysis_a_lot_looking_for_answers/,53051.0,1669516921,0,,False,1669516936,1669817968,2022-11-27 02:42:01,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"I started a new antidepressant recently and all went well for the first week or so. I had heard that nightmares were common with this medication but since I didn’t get any in the first week, I was no longer worried Then my doc increased the dose.

I am 4 days in. Last night I had the most terrifying nightmare that ended with a false awakening and sleep paralysis. I do not even want to describe it. It felt so vivid and real that for hours afterwards I was so scared that it had actually happened. It was *the scariest* thing I have ever experienced. I didn’t sleep after that. 

As the day has progressed on, the more scared I am becoming to go to sleep. I was wondering if there was anything over the counter that I can take tonight that will help me and hold me over until I can talk to my doctor tomorrow about changing something. I am literally so scared of experiencing the horrific demonic nightmare/SP I had last night.

Sleepparalysis,"The first time I had a SP episode I was 15. I struggle with addiction, and i noticed I seem to have the most episodes when I stop using or in the beginning of my sobriety for a few weeks then they stop. But it's getting worse.

Context: about 3 years ago I decided I was ready to change. So I checked myself into a inpatient recovery program. I rented out my house, took time off from working at the hospital, and took a semester off so I could focus on recovering. I've been sober since. 

About a week ago I had a vivid ""using dream""(most recovering addicts get them). I woke up freaking out because I thought I had relapsed and couldn't remember it, so I went to go get drug tested..then I woke up. I HAD A DREAM INSIDE A DREAM. Has anyone had one of thoes, If so can you tell me about it?

That freaked me out, but it was nothing compared to what happened last night. I was on the couch and I was trying so hard to stay awake and watch a movie but I kept dozing off. At one point I fell asleep and less then a minute later, it felt like something ramed into the couch, and my whole body jolted awake and my heart was racing. I went upstairs and fell asleep pretty quickly. I stared having an episode, I couldn't move, and I was watching this thing crouching upside down on the ceiling next to my roommate then it was on the ground and crawled onto her bed. I was trying to scream but I couldn't open my mouth. Then the weirdest part, I was screaming with my mouth closed.( Think of the sound of yelling with your mouth closed) I was hearing my self do that, and I woke up. It was a dream. I had a dream about my SP, but it wasn't actually SP, I was asleep. 

My roommate said I've been crying, sobbing, and yelling in my sleep. And sometimes I hear myself doing it and it wakes me up. This has started causing me severe anxiety and panic attacks when night rolls around, I've been flinching at every noise I hear, and overall feeling strange at night.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve had about 5 episodes before, some of them aren’t as intense. During the second one I heard audio hallucinations of footsteps and felt my covers being pulled over my bed. Beforehand I had taken some Valium/Trazedone that night to help sleep but I think that triggered it. 

This latest one happened a few mins ago, I had taken 1mg Xanax around 3:30am. Around 8am I felt as if I woke up. I stared at my ceiling and then all of a sudden my body started vibrating all over. Then, I was floating on my back adjacent to my bed. I was able to turn my neck slightly and saw a very blurry depiction of myself still in my bed. I should’ve recognized this as a sleep paralysis episode then and there but my brain felt so disoriented that I couldn’t make the connection, it was still in the dream-like state where my rational thinking part of my brain isn’t quite there. I called out to a family member and started to panic a bit - after what felt like a few minutes, I hallucinated my father coming into my room, he put me back in my bed, my visuals got DMT-esque. My dad seemed distraught and said “oh son, you’re having a heart attack”. I woke up from the panic after that. 

Do benzos trigger episodes for you? The nights in which I’ve been sober seem a lot less scary. I’ve read a good amount of what to do to lessen how scary/intense the episodes are, the answer seems to be letting yourself know that it is just sleep paralysis - how can I get better at spotting it when my brain is still in a delirious type state where I can’t think as clearly? I tired the trick of not breathing but that didn’t snap me out of it.

Sleepparalysis,"Lmao just had another experience of sleep paralysis, so i watched the Brazil vs Serbia match today hence didn't get a lotta sleep. Thus tired and nothing else to do (fucking bunked class and did care to touch books lmao) I slept which even though I don't have a habit taking mid day naps. Then I felt asleep like usual went into light sleep where I could sense some stuff around me but was still asleep. Then had a round of deep sleep where I couldn't sense or feel anything no more. I guess they say you don't see dreams in deep sleep or mine wasn't deep enough to begin with idk but i saw a dream ofc a stressful one too classic me i guess.

 So the dreams set up was that i was put in a random play where students of a or multiple schools came with guns to shoot the teachers which i think were in defence tryna fight back to lmao. Hence an all out gun warfare was bought to breakout and like any logical person would do i tried to get out of that situation thus the stress then I saw a deja vu in a dream which was a deja vu of a dream weird eh?

 And after all that dream shit ended. I thought I was finally awake ""haha that was a fun one"" i thought to myself but hey what is this, this feels... a bit odd.. huh? I can't move... Hmm I see I'm experiencing a sleep paralysis. Time to take it like a pro. Or so I thought, i kind of knew it was futile to try to wake up cus you most like won't be able to. So i tried to sleep back and like an idiot tried to pull up the sheet upto my face to block any light coming into my eyes. From my senses I could think, and open like 3% of my eye lid, ears didn't work i guess didn't sense em. So confident that I'm awake and fully aware (I'm such an idiot) tried to pull the sheets up just in vain. Huh i really can't move eh so what if I tried going sideways. I hand a metallic bottle at the edge of my bed (70 cm wide bed i guess lmao) so to make me up completely or just in attempts to make my roomate (who also bunked his class and was in a room adjacent to me playing ml full concentration idk why i thought this would work but you'll soon find out why) come here and wake me up. 

And so i successful pushed the bottle down hurray!!...? ""why no make sound 🦍🙉🐒"" You heard that? Yes me neither that shit made of metal didn't even make a bit of sound. Or may be my ears aren't really working.... Hey what is this oh it's him my roommate his in my room now randomly I'm confident the bottle wasn't the one that brought him here and i can hear him playing the game... He's just right there on another mates bed which is right next to me i can reach that bed and touch his head or something (he was lying down with his head towards me) so I magically stretched out hand idk how i did it when going back i couldn't move even an eye lid. Then it happens he feels my hand and kinda gets jumpscared (lmao i thought) smiling (which was also a way to interact with him which would make him think I'm awake thus making him talk loud to me which could potentially wake me up fully, 10^69420 IQ play). 

And it was at that moment that i started to struggle to breathe. To cope with it i used my mouth instead. He should notice now right that somethings going wrong with me...right? No, no, instead he fucking chokes me with his hand open and in a chopping position kinda like this but rotated 90° ✋. He presses it against my exposed neck and starts choking me ""Mate this ain't funny mate you fucking saw rn that I was already struggling to breathe tf man this ain't funny no prank"" for a solid 2-4 secs i couldn't breathe at all. 

But then I woke up... Looked around and behold the bottle hadn't even fallen lmao. I got played hard. That was all a dream I mean sleep paralysis with a dream I mean yep i wasn't aware enough to not be in a dream 🤡🤡. Though my plan was successful i guess, i managed to bring my classmate close tho in a dream and he tho was choking me I woke up 😎

Sleepparalysis,"I'm only 15 years old and I've never researched the subject of dreams, but when I dream I like to notice what happens and here's what I realized about sleep paralysis:
First, I must tell you my theory about dreams:
When I was going to sleep, I noticed the following things:
First, you seem to be more ""relaxed"", you breathe more slowly and you don't care about the world around you anymore
After that, your body starts to become paralyzed and difficult to move.  I remember moving my arm to make sure I was awake and the more time passed the harder it was to move
After a while more images begin to appear on the ""dark screen"" of your closed eyes, with the darkness itself forming to make images and you begin to dream.  In this part, it is already super difficult to move and you have to have a good willpower to do it
When I tried to move in that part, I started to dream that I had my eyes open but I couldn't move and I even thought that I really had my eyes open, but after I actually managed to open my eyes I realized that it was all one dream. This has happened several times
My theory about sleep paralysis is that you, at some point in the night, try to move, but you can't because your body is paralyzed, and so you accidentally dream that you're trapped in your bed and think it's reality
And in one of my sleep paralysis, I realized that it was much easier for you to wake up trying to move your head, because with your head shaking your body would alert more than the simple movement of your fingers, which was what I could do in this state.
So the tip for those of you who have sleep paralysis is: relax and realize that this is just a dream and feel the touch of your bed so you can try to move better your body and especially your head
And a ""consequence"" that occurred to me yesterday when I escaped from a sleep paralysis that I myself created on purpose: when I opened my eyes, the world around me was all divided into white squares, as if a grid had been placed in front of my eyes. I believe this was because my brain was still in ""dream mode"" and was still forming images in the dark",t2_d0nm2kjp,0,About how to wake up in sleep paralysis and the consequences of this,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,z3p0ag,True,InevitableHungry5097,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/z3p0ag/about_how_to_wake_up_in_sleep_paralysis_and_the/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/z3p0ag/about_how_to_wake_up_in_sleep_paralysis_and_the/,53022.0,1669309138,0,,False,1669309151,1669818603,2022-11-24 16:58:58,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"
So, I’m 34yo, and 27weeks pregnant and as soon as I had tested positive (right around 3-4w) I immediately stopped smoking pot. I first got SP when I was like 5, but fairly regularly starting at age 7. Nothing ever helped SP, except pot which I didn’t use until I was 28, so, definitely lived with it for a long time. At that time, my episodes would consist of very intense auditory and visual hallucinations, and they would occur several times a night, several nights a week - I would have to miss work from it, it was that bad. When I started smoking, I would get less frequent, and way less intense episodes - like, maybe a few every few months. Huge difference. Now that I am pregnant, I know I am not supposed to sleep on my back, but it happens. I still get SP when on my side, but the episodes that happen on my back are the most intense I’ve ever felt. Last night, I had an episode on my side, which wasn’t too bad and I was able to pull myself out of it enough to adjust positions. However, unfortunately, I ended up on my back and that lead to such intense auditory and visual hallucinations of something or someone grabbing my arms and pulling me, and squeezing my face, and even could feel those sensations, and it was getting so hard to breathe. Now, I have had enough practice with SP to focus on controlled breathing but this is the first time I’ve been pregnant and sleeping on your back can affect your breathing from what I understand. Usually, my husband wakes up to me jerking my arms, or breathing heavily and grumbling and can wake me up out of it completely. I was trying to scratch myself awake, sometimes I slip out of it enough to be able to pinch or scratch my arm. Back when I had really bad episodes in my 20s, I would move a lot without waking myself up and I actually clawed my face (had gnarly scratches on my cheek and jaw). But this time idk what all happened I just know that I was able to yell out loud enough to wake him up (yell to me, but.. to him he just heard intense grumbling). From my perspective, I was screaming and clawing at my face like I used to, but apparently, I was just laying there like dead weight. It was crazy bc like I said I could feel something grabbing me but also I could feel the sting of my nails dragging across my skin even though I wasn’t moving. Anyway I remember hubs asking if I was awake, and okay and I said yeah, and I rolled over on my side, and was able to fall back to sleep without slipping back into it again. When I came to still on my back, I could feel the pins and needles feeling of like, limbs falling asleep but all over, head to toe, so, I think the extra weight in my abdomen putting pressure on the vena cava (large vein that brings blood from the extremities to the heart) is what’s triggering it to be so incredibly intense. I have tried both pregnancy pillows and regular pillows to keep myself in a side-laying position, but I always end up on my back. I do plan to talk to my OB Monday about supplements that are pregnancy safe that I can take, but in my experience, there have only been two doctors (a ENT and a sleep specialist) who have known anything about SP (ENT experienced them himself and when I told him about pot helping me he was like… well I guess I need to make a phone call to my friend later hahah so he def wasn’t giving advice on the matter, he was seeking advice for himself) so, curious - are any of you who experience SP pregnant, have been, or know someone who is/was and have any advice on pregnancy safe supplements that can help decrease the intensity? (Any suggestions I would still clear with my OB obviously I just have a feeling if I straight up ask my OB about sleep paralysis they’ll probably look at me like “um, what?” as that has been my experience with most doctors, and it’s not like SP is a thing most people deal with regularly), I just know pot was the only thing I ever found relief with, and I’m not sure what else to do.

Well, I have, and I’ve noticed since then (about 3 years ago) certain connections between dream experiences, particularly sleep paralysis type experiences, and my DMT experience.

Sometimes after truly awakening from a spell of SP, I will see lingering visuals in my environment, while I seem to be fully awake and back in the reigns as it were. Often times they are patterns, shapes, pictures on the walls. Like shadows almost, that gradually fade away the “more awake” I become after awakening. Sometimes however it will be visuals of say demon hands gripping the doorway and peaking out subtly, that again fade away within a short amount of time. Less often I will hear lingering echoes of voices or other sounds from my dream or SP. I relate all of this to DMT because the experiences are very similar to what happened when I was “coming down” from DMT and still had lingering effects while being mostly aware and everything and back in the control room.

Sleepparalysis,"Let me explain.

So I often have issues with sleep, sleep paralysis, night terrors, dreams/nightmares that feel like they last years on the inside where I kinda forget where I am when I wake up; sometimes if it's really bad, it'll happen midday where I swear to God nothing was happening a few minutes ago. I probably should see someone about it but I have no insurance and can't get around to places anyways without help or serious planning so I just learn to deal with it. 

This is related to the happening midday but one I found really concerning because it. Wasn't horrifying and happened when I was trying to force myself to sleep. It looked, felt, and even smelled super real and I wasn't really able to move so I guess???

So basically as mentioned, I'm in my bed trying to fall asleep, facing my closet. My door is open and the light from the bathroom in the hall is still bright enough to be in my peripheral. I suddenly hear some very familiar heavy footfalls as someone then flops into my bed. From the heavy smell of cold and cigarettes from his leather jacket as well as the fact that I can hear his grumbling I can tell it's my dad. He then proceeds to use my back as a pillow while I ask him what the fuck he's doing here and he's like ""what, are you too old to be my pillow now?""

Naturally aside from being a bit weird as for the most part my father tries to pretend I don't exist most days, only really calling me for holidays or if he's worried I'm dead, it wasn't that horrifying and I just kinda fell into a different sleep afterwards.

I tried to wake up but it didn't work, i was full concious knowing that i'm dreaming and was searching for a way out. 
Sometimes some people were trying to help but at a certain time i teleported back into my bed and all began again.
In the longest time i went on without a teleportation i was with my ex and my family but suddendly they were speaking danish or something and i couldn't understand them. I tried to explain whats happening and also to google how to wake up but my phone was set in danish so i wasn't able to use google properly.
 I think my ex understood me and kinda tried to tell me that i have to expirience a major stimulus like an earthquake or something in the world my body is sleeping in, in order to wake up. 
So this really happened and a flood or something shook up the train waggon i was sleeping in (no idea how i got there.) And i woke up. 
My friend was there comforting me and i cried just happy i made it out of that prison of a dream. 
In that moment i woke up again with a gasp but in the real world now.

Sleepparalysis,A couple nights ago I fell asleep like normal not expecting anything to happen and i didn’t have any nightmares but I remember sleeping on my stomach face down and waking up with my head in the pillow barely able to breathe. at first I didn’t know what was happening and I tried to move but I couldn’t my legs were twitching and my arms were twitching but I could not move. About 15 minutes into it I heard footsteps and some laughter and started getting tickled the tickling went on for about three hours and I was able to breathe. I didn’t feel anything on my chest but it hurt my ribs after about 2 minutes really bad. I remember crying but no tears were coming out and I tried to bite my lip to wake myself up but my mouth couldn’t move. I woke up a couple hours later terrified jumped out of bed and stretched to see if the pain that I felt during the tickling was real and it was not I was not sore at all one bit but I felt it and I experienced it and it felt like absolute torture. Ever since I’ve been going to sleep at about 5 AM every single night it’s been three days since this has happened and I am still scared. I took two naps today and both times had horrible nightmares however I did not experience any type of sleep paralysis that I am aware of. I don’t know for sure how long the tickling went on for but it was on my ribs it almost felt like it was all over my body and it felt like about three hours in real time and I tried to scream and I remember myself hearing the noise and it sounded like a small ahh and that’s it. I am truly terrified and I haven’t told anyone about this yet I hope someone can give me some form of information or help or advice because I’m too scared to sleep now because of how much my ribs hurt that night. this 100% happened to me none of this is fake I am not making it up for likes and I really truly do need some help or advice or information on what’s happening while I’m asleep.

Sleepparalysis,"idk if this is important, but i’ve always had sleeping issues. i have restless leg syndrome, sleep paralysis, and i started wetting the bed once or twice a month a few years ago. i’ve been to doctors about that and had studies done and everything, but no one can figure out the cause. i’m not sure if it’s related to this or not, though. 

i (17f) have been experiencing sleep paralysis for the past 5 years or so, and it’s terrible. i experience it almost every night, and oftentimes it occurs a few times in one night as i’m trying to sleep. i hear strange noises and feel as though someone has poured concrete over my limbs, rendering me incapable of any movement. it’s exhausting to get out of, as is typical for sleep paralysis. 

however, it’s been getting worse recently, as far as what i see and how i feel throughout it. i always close my eyes to avoid seeing weird creatures in my bedroom during it, but now i see strange scenes (like a dream) as i’m paralyzed. sometimes it’s just straight up weird stuff, like one time i saw a drowning lion and last night i saw a terrified woman running away from something or someone while carrying an infant. other times it’s more morbid and i’ll see gruesome deaths and whatnot, which is pretty petrifying in the moment. 

i know they’re not nightmares because i’m never apart of the dreams, im just a paralyzed bystander, completely aware of the fact that it’s all fake. i just didn’t know sleep paralysis could be like that??

i also keep getting really intense and weird sensations all over my body during paralysis. like my brain will feel like it’s on fire, or i’ll feel someone touching me in inappropriate places, which is uncomfortable and terrifying, or i’ll feel just really horrible all over my body for a while and legitimately think i’m dying for a second. it’s so strange and awful to experience. is that what sleep paralysis is like for most people??

Life has been very hectic for my family lately. A lot of Hospital visits and surgeries for the last 2 weeks. 

But when we got back home after all that I was laid on my bed just resting, thinking about taking a nap. 

When all of a sudden I was woken up by what sounded like a man with deep voice speaking latin, or some other ancient language that I did not understand, into my left ear. 

It was not English nor Spanish since i know those.

But SP was in full effect and I found my body heavy and not being able to move. On top of that my body now being sideways when I was just laying on my back a few sec ago. 

I tried to turn my head to see who was speaking but I could not. The voice was loud and it kept chanting in that other language into just my left ear. 

All the mean while I was trying to turn my head, it felt like it was shaking / vibrating just from trying to look to who or what it was. I could not turn my head no matter how hard I tried. 

To me it felt like it was preventing me from looking. It was very scary to be completely honest. 

The voice kept speaking / chanting and I kept trying to move for what felt like 1 Full slow motion minute.

After a while I was able to wiggle finger then hands and then finally kicked out. 

That has never happened to me. 

I stood up and checked the house to see who was here, but it was only me and my father. 

He was still asleep in the living room with headphones on. No one else at the house. No TVs, no phones, no radio Nothing. 

I think someone is doing voodoo on me lol.

When I have what I think is sleep paralysis I wake up completely aware I am not in a half asleep state my mind is fully awake.I do not hallucinate or see things that are not there ( perhaps this is more common than you read on the internet) I can see what’s around me my eyes are open but slightly blurred ( if there is light in the bedroom or it has happened in the day while napping ) I can hear &amp; I can feel I.e my fiancé sleeping next to me . I can’t move and I can’t shout for help . This happens often perhaps monthly it will usually be in the middle of night I will wake up randomly and get stuck in sp or it can happen if I have a day nap. It either resolves after awhile of trying to fight it or I fall asleep again but remember next day ( the second is more rare I usually try and fight it and eventually escape it ) ( this confirms my eyes are open as once I can move again I am still looking at same stuff I saw before) .

Sleepparalysis,"I have had sleep paralysis for a couple years now, and if I have learned one thing, it’s to keep my eyes shut during the experience so as to not see the gut wrenching figures often right on top of me.  A while ago I had this moment where I opened my eyes to a very large, pitch black humanoid figure not three inches away from my face, while a deep and loud void like sound was blaring over everything (much like the sound you would hear while yawning, only without the small ring and much, much louder). So I tend to keep my eyes closed until it’s over, and that has been working until recently.  

Whenever I have sleep paralysis, now I feel and hear punching right next to my head, almost as if the figure is trying to get me to open my eyes without touching me.  Very strange.  Now here is the weird part.  From what I understand, sleep paralysis can be caused by jet lag, or other dramatic changes to your sleep schedule.  I eat healthy and exercise on a regular basis, but I have struggled with sleep most of my life.  But even on good weeks where I’m consistently getting 8-9 hours, eating healthy, and exercising regularly, I’ll still get terrifying episodes of sleep paralysis.

Sleepparalysis,"Okay so, when I was a child about 5-6 I had these obscure dream like experiences? It so hard to explain so I’ll do my best. I’d wake up out of dead sleep and know it was about to happen because my sense of touch was all messed up. Textures would feel not like they were supposed to. I’d look around and know where I was so i know I wasn’t disoriented. But after I notice that my touch was weird I’d start hearing what sounded like lots of people yelling at me at once. It would scare me so I’d start crying and hyperventilating. My mom would come into my room to try and comfort me but she would look weird. Her head would be too small for her body and it was scare me more. When she would rub my leg or arm out of comfort it was feel like she was rubbing my skin off. 

Like is said idk if this was a form of a night terror or paranormal but I know it’s real because my older sister had the exact same thing happen to her, down to the T in details. Happened a lot but stopped after childhood.

Sleepparalysis,"first time posting about this so I hope it makes sense. I began experiencing SP without ever knowing what it was as I lived in a religious household. my mom explained a similar occurance she experienced as she states she called a catholic hotline that prayed it away, so I took her at her word until I decided to look it up and found out so many ppl experience the same thing as me. I experienced mostly hat man experiences at first that were terrifying to me and I'd wake up crying but once I learned about SP and how to combat it I found it very easy to wake up from them and I stopped having them(or at least remembering them, but I also have experienced pleasant SP (or what I think it is) it was similar in exp as SP in that I felt not asleep but in these exp I'm always like groggy or trying to go back to sleep, I'm sleeping on my stomach(so different from my back sleeping visual hallucination trigger) and my eyes are closed. I've had multiple experiences of feeling my bed depress as if someone sat at the edge of the bed, I've had one experience where it felt like someone crawled over to me in bed as if not to wake me and rubbed me down the length of my back and then left,  and I've also had one experience where I felt 2 hands gently on my lower back and butt just rocking me awake.in all my experiences I never feel scared it actually felt very nice until my groginess clears up and I realize no one is in the room and then I wake up and feel slightly freaked out.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve had sleep paralysis episodes since my early teen years.  Over the last 10 years, they’ve slowly increased in frequency from once a year to once every few months.  I started Lamotrigine in August to treat my BPD symptoms.  Since then, it seems I have an episode at least once a week and now it’s more difficult to get out of SP.  I have actually always had to focus moving one limb, as wiggling toes or swishing my tongue has never worked, and that breaks me out of it, but that has started to not work.  Now, I feel this awful straining sensation til I give up.  I eventually break out of it after trying for several minutes, but obviously it’s alarming when your usual tricks don’t work as well.  One time I managed to slowly move my head, but after I stopped trying it snapped back to where it was before which has never happened until then.

Sleepparalysis,"Okok i’m not too familiar with what exactly sleep paralysis is, but what happened the other night actually felt like a near death experience. I can remember all of the dreams I had that night so vividly, first I was in my friends backyard hiding in a corn field with her, then I was in my living room and my neighbor brought her kid over to baby sit, then it all changed. 

I remember the scene warping or glitching almost, and then I was in a cave. The cave was cold and snowy kinda like one of those dungeons from Skyrim, and as soon as the dream started I heard a robotic voice speaking in a language that doesn’t exist. I couldn’t understand it at all, though it sounded female? I walked through the cave and it opened up into a bigger ravine almost. At this point another robotic voice started speaking to me this time in english and it was male. He was basically telling me to go through the ravine to the next cave, but the way he spoke made me uneasy. Using phrases like “ascend from this place” “you must move on” The whole thing was scary. Very different from my other dreams that night.   At this point I knew I was dreaming but couldn’t seem to wake myself up. As I walked closer to the entrance of another cave, the one the voice was telling me to enter, I immediately knew I shouldn’t go there. I ran back where I came from, and that’s when it started to get very scary. As i ran out of the bigger ravine, the dream glitched again, then restarted. The same female robotic voice speaking the unknown language, followed by the male voice. Only this time he was angry at me. He told me it was too late, id gone too far, there was nothing left for me here. Most of the things he was saying I don’t remember anymore bc they were very cryptic. Basically telling me to “move on.” I knew i needed to wake up but i couldn’t. I kept running back and the dream kept restarting,  a “glitch” then the first voice, then the second. each time he was getting angrier at me. I remember thinking that if i didn’t wake up I was going to die. I remember thinking that i’d never see my pets again, or my friends, or my house or the sky. Finally i got one of my eyes open. Now for the weird part, and the reason why I’m posting in this sub specifically; I remember looking at my window, the poster on my wall, the tree in my front yard. I was consciously awake I was looking at my reality… but I could still hear his voice. After a few more minutes or seconds i’m not sure i finally could open my other eye and it stopped.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello I'm going to share an experience that happens to me for like a week, wanting to know if anybody else went through the same thing:

When I try to sleep, I can literally straight away dream, but I am awake still. just dreaming. usually it is vivid nightmares/ lucid nightmares

and when I try to wake up, I realize that I'm paralyzed, and the body feels like it's asleep, but I cannot fully stop the nightmare although I am AWAKE.


I used to have sleep paralysis a lot over the years, but this kind of one I never had before, never happened to me that I dreamt while still being awake, the worst part is that I'm having nightmares with it, so it's not that fun to have.

I also deal with headaches to the rest of the day.

I want to stop it but I'm not sure why it happens. im scared to take any medications to sleep, because I'm afraid it might make it worse.

Sleepparalysis,"Last night I had my first experience with sleep paralysis.. I think lmk if this sounds like it, I still don’t know. 
I was out drinking with some friends, I think I was about 10 shots deep and a beer. Came home went to bed. My gf is already asleep. Where I’m from it’s really cold so she likes to sleep with the heating vent open. I hate this because I always have terrible sleep and wake up in a cold sweat. I’m piss drunk so I don’t care about closing the vent I just crash instantly upon the back of my head touching the pillow. I had a really weird dream where I was at a popular beach on an island, (lots of people there) there was a yellow house on the top of a cliff side overlooking the beach itself. Beside it was an old wooden staircase to get down to the beach. In the water was lots of boats and some docks people were using to Jump off of. I’m out at one of the docks having fun on the sunny day when out of nowhere the sky turns black and everyone start running. I get knocked off the dock swim to shore and run up the stairs, but before I can reach the top I see someone hiding underneath the part of the house curled up in a ball I go to help him whilst everyone else is running like chickens with their heads cut off. He’s a south East Asian guy (i think) and he’s looking at me in the eyes and says “help me” and tells me his name. (I forgot, i think it was like Hano or hanta something like that) I try to tell him to get out but he just won’t eventually I give up and run for it. As I’m running up the wooden stairs I look back and see the house collapse with him still in it. This is where that dream ends. (My dreams are usually speratic and don’t stick together so long) the next “dream” is what I think the actual sleep paralysis starts. I’m in my room how I fell asleep on my back. It’s probably 5 am, my bed is detector underneath my window and infront of my computer. My eyes are open and I can only look forward towards my pc. In the chair facing the computer is somebody all pitch black. I can’t make out a single feature about them. Not only because their not facing me but also because they are literally pitch black. They started speaking to me, but it sounded like they were speaking to me from inside of my head even thought they were on the other side of the room from me. They had a deep and dark menacing voice. It told me to look up outside of my window. I tied to but I couldn’t move my head oreyes that far. In the top corner of my eye I saw something in the window I couldn’t make out what it was but somehow I knew it was a person or a human like thing looking at me. tried to shoot up out of bed but I couldn’t. I tried to yell but I couldn’t. None of my body parts were responding. I couldn’t move at all. I was freaking out then I noticed that the thing sitting in the chair started to slowly face me.(the chair is a roller chair so it can spin around). Again i tried to yell as loud as I possibly could but I just couldn’t. It was still speaking to me, it knew my name. Something told me it was the man underneath the house in the previous dream. I don’t know how I knew but I did. just about when it was about to show it’s face to me my girlfriend woke me up. My eyes opened and the room was the same. But the chair was in the same position as it was when the thing was turning around. It had a bunch of clothes on it because the room was dirty. I was in a cold sweat but that was it.

I've had reoccurring sleep paralysis since I was young, I used to get it once a week. But around the time of high school I realized that it mainly occurred when I slept on my back. To prevent it as much as possible I started sleeping on my sides and stomach, this lessened the frequency to once a lonth or once every 2 months. When I sleep on my sides however, since it's the most comfortable position, I sometimes end up turning over on my back and it's like a dice roll most of the time I get in the state of sleep paralysis, other times I don't.

Sleepparalysis,"
Woke up in SP this morning not long after my wife had gone to work. Everything seemed normal at first as always, until I felt my wife pressed up against my left arm and could hear her heavy breathing.
That’s when I realised I couldn’t move, and  knew this was SP. 

So I lay there struggling as I always do screaming in my head to wake up and that it’s not my wife laying next to me. I kept saying to myself “that’s not my wife. That’s not my wife. That’s not my wife”. I could feel the pressure of what ever it was on my left arm and pressed up against my body. 

But the most absolutely nightmare thing happed next and I’d never experienced it before. It actually spoke to me. I don’t know if it spoke to me out aloud, or if it was in my head. Regardless of how it spoke, I could hear it loud and clear. It spoke an a rough but genital voice like a hiss. All it said was “ You know what I want. You know what I want” I freaked out so badly i woke my self up. 

So I woke up in a panic immediately rolled over to my left side as I sleep on my back. Obviously nothing was there, but I tell you now that my left arm where I could feel the pressure of it laying was completely numb. Numb from my shoulder to my wrist. And it stayed that way for close to an hour.

So yeah that was my SP experience this morning and it’s completely freaked me out as to where I’m actually afraid to go to sleep tonight.

Sleepparalysis,"When I was in college, I napped on my couch. I fell asleep around my roommates. They went to church while I napped. Except, that didn’t happen. I dreamt they left, said bye to me. And when I woke up with them still in the room I asked when they got back… they said they never left. That was the first time. 

After that, all of my “sleep paralysis” consisted of me being unable to move, what I felt like screaming “wake me up” to my roommates. I even dreamt once I flung myself out of my bed and centipede crawled to my roommates room to tell her to wake me up. 

I’ve had that same sensation many times since then, just being in the room I’m in unable to wake up and screaming to the person next to me to wake me up. 

I just considered myself a “lucky” person who experiences sleep paralysis because they aren’t scary, mostly. Although, once I told myself “don’t look in the closet because you will scare yourself”

But after some research I’m just wondering if it was sleep paralysis at all, or if I just have night terrors?

Sleepparalysis,"Mine was when I fell asleep with some music playing accidentally and fell asleep on my back. I woke up paralyzed with the usual sp symptoms like ringing sounds, trying to move makes it worse, etc. Then I heard clashing of pots and pans from my kitchen and I lived alone.

Honestly does anyone know why sleeping paralysis only happens when sleeping on the back for some people? And was there blood flow issues to my brain maybe which is why I felt like I was dying? it sucks because Id love to sleep on my back...

Sleepparalysis,"Last night’s “episode” made me finally look up this Reddit and I’m glad I did, lots of useful information here. I remember when I was around 12 and saw people talking about lucid dreaming online. Now I don’t remember if I actually tried to lucid dream, I think I did, but ever since learning about it, it has been a constant visitor for 15 years and I absolutely hate it. 
I have never seen any strange figures, I think that’s because when I first learned about it they always said, don’t open your eyes! But who knows. Anyway I don’t remember much about past activities, but atleast in the past couple of years it has never occurred when I’m asleep. It only happens when I’m just about to fall, I feel this numbing sensation taking over my body and I try to quickly change my position to stop it but it never stops. Once I feel it coming, I know I’m going to be in hell for the next 2 hours or so. 
Once I’m paralyzed I start buzzing all over my body, sometimes feeling like I’m flying and hearing loud music. Yesterday I heard some creepy voices but I can’t remember what it said anymore. I am generally able to get out of a paralysis quickly as I think I have mastered it over the years. I try to quickly and suddenly shake myself up, which always ends up freaking my partner out as I’m making some weird noises while struggling and end up grasping air once I’m out. 
But the worst damn thing, as soon as I get out, it comes back right away, sometimes even before I get to close my eyes again. I keep changing positions and try to make myself more “wake” but it never works. For the next couple of hours it’s just a cycle that I can’t get out of. Until eventually it just stops. 
I feel like there’s something wrong with me, how and why does it keep happening fairly often for 15 years? I have a very normal sleep schedule, only thing I have is probably work stress.

Sleepparalysis,"I am 25 years old and I have never experienced sleep paralysis until 3 days ago. It was about scary, but thankful I read a lot about it before to get out of the experience quickly. I'm also thankful it was simply auditory and It just sounded like some inhuman thing swearing at me to stop masturbating lol

Anyways, I thought ""wow, what a scary experience, but thankful they are rare"". Boy, was I wrong. Every night, I feel myself entering sleep paralysis. I quickly recognize that I can't move and that if I don't start focusing on moving a finger or something, I'm going to start hallucinating. I haven't seen anything yet, and I really don't want to because I think my anxiety will shoot through the roof and I'll lose focus on getting out of it. I thought it was because I was sleeping on my back, but I just got it sleeping on my side and now I'm scared. 

Anyways, I don't really know why this is happening. 
The only thing I can think is that I pulled a muscle on my back neck/back shoulder/blade or slept wrong about a little over a week ago and haven't really woken up comfortably. I can't really turn my neck to the right without some help of also turning my body. 
I don't even know if that had anything to do with the sleep paralysis, but it is getting scary. 
I don't want to see things. I don't want to hear screaming or footsteps and I especially don't want to feel things or I'm going to freak the fuck out. I just want to sleep and wake up like normal.

Sleepparalysis,"This was a really bad one, so I’m awake at 3am on my phone because I kept falling back asleep and going back into it. 

It started off as a sort of dream. I was with my grandmother but she seemed younger, we were at this big old house with a body of water off to the side. I ended up in the water but was not able to swim, and I was face down. I could hear her (slowly) coming to help, and could feel her pulling my leg to get me out but she would not flip me over, so that I could breathe. I felt her begin to flip my body and immediately I was sent into sleep paralysis. 

(Except I still couldn’t breathe, which was terrible because I thought I figured out how to control my breathing during an episode)

During the episode I was terrified. It felt like I woke up but I was still half asleep and went back into it. Then I heard scary noises like a evil male presence and voice, and I tried to think of a song to distract me from my fear. I woke again (this time I’m positive) but slipped away again so quickly back into that hell. 

This time I could feel that I was very close to my husband. I could hear myself groaning for him to help me, and I actually felt my hand lightly hitting him (as hard as I could muster in my state) and then I heard myself get louder saying “help, help, help”. I was trying so hard to speak and I could hardly breathe. Then I woke up and actually hit him and said “you didn’t wake me up!! 😅 I’m not sure if any of that actually happened or it was part of a hallucination (that’s happened before, felt him there once but he had already gone to work). 

Anyway typing this made me feel better, I was afraid I was slipping away again so I picked up my phone to keep me awake.

Sleepparalysis,"I'm someone with 50+ sleep paralysis incidents or more. It started when I started living out of my house and bleh bleh forget the boring stuffs. I have exprienced many types of sleep paralysis, audial, visual and some doctor strange shit like in the last fight where same thing happens again and again well those were some interesting and frightening experiences I can share them if you want. 

Anyways, I had been researching different techniques during my episodes of sleep paralysis and finally found something turns this sleep paralysis into pleasure. DOn't struggle just let it be and think of getting blowjob from hot demon lmao. It is still scary but just keep thinking about it and try to   
imagine, it is quite hard to imagine and feel like that when you are fcking scared and frightened but just keep at it, even I sometimes switched from imagining to calling god names and I feel little guilty lol anyways I persisted and damn it got pleasurable really!! it felt like my lower body was a little hot and vibrating a little and was something inside my blanket. In short, I turned my sleep paralysis into wetdream without the ejaculating lol. I have done this tactic twice and it worked both times, just don't give up and keep imagining even if you get scared or frightened it gets better next time. Let me tell you not only sleep paralysis but I have much more exprience in wetdreams like 100+? and lots of shitty nights because of waking up at night to clean up underwear. anyways, I have reasearched much more stuff in those hehe and have lots of hacks if you want to know. Also I had noticed maybe common knowledge but sleep paralysis mostly happens when I sleep late, think about ghosts or sleep paralysis before bed.

Sleepparalysis,"I experienced multiple sleep paralysis today (in a row) and these are what I noticed before and during my sleep paralysis.

before- my vision gets very blurry, like the drunk kind of blurry.

\- my eyes try very hard to close.

during- most of the time there arent any figures

\-even tho there werent any demons or figures I still felt scared (I don't know why)

I got out of all of them in less than 5 seconds by doing the right foot trick.

more details: 

Got off work and arrived home (4am). I laid down on my bed and just browsed the internet/watched yt videos. I was about to fall asleep (maybe about 430am) when my vision went blurry and my eyes tried to close, at that point I knew i was about to experience sleep paralysis. I entered sleep paralysis and I was thankful that there werent any figures but for an unknown reason I still felt scared. I remembered the right foot trick and got out of it. I continued to get sleep paralysis for 10m straight. 

1-vision gets blurry and eyes try to close. 2- I try my best to resist closing my eyes. 3- I fail to resist and eventually close my eyes and fall into sleep paralysis. 4- I get out by doing the right foot trick. 5- back to number 1. It kept repeating and repeating for what felt like 10m. Until I finally stood up and browsed the internet to stop myself from falling into SP again.

Sleepparalysis,"I consider myself lucky. I have sleep paralysis almost every day and everytime i want. That is because i have an allergy, and my nose is always full, so i wake up very ofter during the night. I leave my phone next to my bed, so i can see what time is it. I also know that my ""strongest"" rem cycle is around 4:30 AM, that is always the time i have lucid dreams and sleep paralysis. But today, i woke up at 4:00, and right after i fell asleep (4:10), i had a sleep paralysis. At first, i was in a dream. I was doing something in my room in that dream. The dream was quite short, because i started hearing some buzzing in my ears. I hear that same buzzing every sleep paralysis, so i knew instantly what is going on. I wanted to try an experiment in sp, and this was the right time. That experiment was about trying to explore sleep paralysis and dreams, and remember everything after waking up. So back to the sp.. I had closed eyes, like always, because i try to move my leg every single time after waking up before opening ny eyes, because you never know when you are awake, ans when you are in sleep paralysis. Trust me, you don't wanna open your eyes in sp. So, a heard a buzzing in my ears, but then someone started screaming in my right ear. It sounded kinda fake, like a sound effect, so i knew it was not real. I was lying on the right side of my body. I was completely consious in the sleep paralysis, so that means i was dreaming when being awake. 
Then this weird thing happened to me. After the screaming stopped, i tried to imagine something, because i was afraid that i will have a bad visual hallucination. The first thing that came to my mind was a meme, that i saw on tiktok yesterday. Then some random memes started playing right before my eyes, while i was still consious, and still in sleep paralysis. This is funny, because many people find sleep paralysis scary, but if you find out that you can watch tiktok memes in sleep paralysis, then you will change your opinion. Back to the sp..

Sleepparalysis,"My aunt and uncle were sleeping together around 4 am my aunt heard him saying sorry to someone in his dream. She didn’t think much of it so she went back to bed. Around 7am, she went to get her daughter ready for school and my uncle took her to school. She went back to bed and sees my uncle coming in to their room from dropping off their daughter in school.So both of them were officially back in bed. Around ten minutes later, my aunt wakes up and says she’s having sleep paralysis. As this is happening to her, she hears her bedroom door open and she sees a shadow in the corner of her eye standing by her side. She says it looks like my uncle but can’t confirm it since she can’t move. The shadow then walks over to my uncles side of the bed, stands there for a bit, and lays down where my uncle is laying. Suddenly, my aunts sleep paralysis is over and she turns over to my uncle and says “did you see that” and he says “what” she says she saw someone lay down in his spot and he says it was him but she says “that was 10 mins ago, im talking about right now.” He then says that his body has been there but his spirit has been walking around, that he was astral projecting. My aunt says he sounded half asleep when he said that so she blew it off thinking it was another weird dream. Later on she asks him why he was saying sorry to someone in the dream earlier. He says he was having a terrible nightmare that him and a family friend were tied up but he got loose as soon and as soon as he did he could hear someone coming in the room so he told the friend he was very sorry and that he would come back to help him which explains why he was saying sorry in his sleep. he then says that he walks through this door that was in his dream and when he walked through it, he ended up in his own bathroom at home. He just assumed he slept walked in the bathroom so he walks out and opens the door to his bedroom and sees himself laying there asleep.

Sleepparalysis,"So I have a really insane experience with sleep paralysis or some demonic attack I have no idea . So my husband has suffered with frequent sleep paralysis since early childhood and I have grown use to knowing the signals when he's about to have them and shake him awake from them . I on the other hand have never personally experience it for myself but I have heard plenty about it . Anyway this was during the pandemic lockdown , my husband was sick which very rarely ever happens but the few times it has he always has sleep paralysis badly and swears he's being attacked because he's weak . So I am laying in bed on the outside as the big spoon And am scrolling on my phone being bored and he starts mumbling and shaking which is the beginning of his paralysis so I shake him awake and he wakes up and mutters ""fucker is trying to get me cause I'm sick""and I respond with ""babe no one is trying to attack you , you're just dreaming"", and literally not even a minute after saying that I go right out I honestly can't even remember going from awake to asleep it was crazy . All of a sudden I feel these long arms with three fingers each and long nails grab my shoulders and try to rip me off the bed I was trying so hard to scream for my husband , when then my husband rips me up out of the dream to waking state and yells"" get in front of me!!!""and I in a complete panic jump in front between him and the wall and start crying ""babe what the hell was that"" and he's like"" I told you something was attacking me"" and i started to cry stating Im scared to fall asleep and then again was out in seconds . This time I felt it's arms grab my ankles and try to pull me off from the foot of the bed I struggled to get sounds out so I could yell for my husband and he again woke me up . It was such an insane experience and even though I never saw what it was but when it grabbed me I instantly had a vivid image of it in my head . It was short in stature about 3 feet and a half with long arms that were the length of it's body with two long fingers and a  thumb . It had a hunched back and it's spine protruded from it . It's skin was brown and leathery . Its shoulders held up it's head as if it had no neck. It had a snarl turned up nose and beady black eyes that sunk in and curled back lips with oversized fangs and an under bite .I also got the sense that it was female and did not like other females but  It literally freaked me out beyond belief and honestly pissed me off because to me it appeared as a low ranking bottom feeding demon who was trying to feed off my fear . 
So this is where this becomes next level freaky . My husband's best friend is really spiritual and is a avid lucid dreamer and practices astral projection. So two days after this sleep paralysis experience his friend stops over and starts to tell us that he had an insane experience with astral projection he said he was in our bedroom and was trying to get my husband's attention and was trying to shake him awake he said my husband's face was black as if he was not available or on the astral plane then he said he felt something  jump on his back and then described this beast word for word as I saw it . I looked at my husband and freaked the hell out and couldn't believe what I was hearing and had no idea what to make of it 
  

Also to add to shared sleep paralysis stories my 11 year old son also inherited his dad's sleep issues and has had sleep paralysis since he could start talking . So about a year ago my husband and I were arguing and I decided I would sleep in my son's room . About a few hours of sleep I feel this hand grab my shoulder and rip on my back and started screaming in my face I then hear loud sirens and I started to scream for my son . The next day I was telling my son that I had sleep paralysis in his bed and before telling him what I saw my son goes ""did it look like this ?"" And describes exactly what I saw . I literally felt so freaked and considering I never had sleep paralysis except these two times I definitely believe that sleep paralysis has something to do with demonic or evil spirits and is not anything dream related

Sleepparalysis,"Not every night but some nights, it repeatedly happens to me as I try to sleep. I don’t remember the details of it happening in the past except for the first time. I was a kid, and I had my eyes open, and I couldn’t move. I felt like I was screaming in my mind to move. 

A similar experience happened when I was hypnotized to stop smoking in a group. I was still wholly conscious, but I had to wiggle my pinky to get my entire body to move eventually. 

It’s much scarier now, and I remember that it happens when it happens. 

Tonight I’ve had 2 or 3 so far. The first one, I didn’t know I was asleep because I thought my eyes were open. My dream started, and I don’t remember much of it now, but I came out of my dream wondering why my room was so dark. I tell myself to open my eyes, and they slam open. 

I go back to sleep, and I start dreaming; this time, I remember being pushed by someone in my dream, and I went flying backward. I realize I’m awake now, but everything’s dark, and I force my eyes open again with the voice in my head. 

The last time I got back to sleep, I was dreaming and was pushed backward down a flight of stairs and landed on my back. I woke up and remembered this has happened a lot, and it’s terrifying, and I’m sick of it, so I came to Reddit and typed sleep in the search to post in r/sleep, but then I saw this auto-populated as I typed my query. 

Sometimes I can’t breathe until I wake and tell myself to breathe then I gasp for air. 

Occasionally my body jerks me awake with such force I strike my boo sleeping next to me. 

Often I remember I am aware of the feeling of suffocation, and I’ll slowly start rocking my head back and forth mentally until my head rocks, my body breaks free, and I gasp for air. 

Sometimes I think my place is haunted, but I get the fuzzy feeling it happens in any bed I’m in, including hotels. 

It helps if I roll over and listen to binaural beats or a sound machine. 

I’m scared to go back to bed mainly cause of my breathing. 

This maybe similar to sleep apnea and something deep sea diver's experience called nitrogen narcosis.

But… gonna try again. Thanks for reading.

Sleepparalysis,"I just woke up from having sleep paralysis. Normally when I have it I feel it right away and can get out of it very easily. I’ve had it my whole life so I know when it happens and can usually avoid the fear now. But just now was so different. I finished my normal dream state (which is actually lucid dreaming) and when I woke up back in my room, everything looked the same. I closed my eyes and then out of me where I hear my mom. She’s singing to me and holding my hand. I was very confused but I love with her so I’d didn’t think much of it. As soon I open my eyes to talk to her, I notice her hair is shorter. My mom just started growing her hair out so it’s a lot longer than it has been my whole childhood. This is how I knew it wasn’t her. I started yelling “mom!” At her but then her smile turned evil. My body started lifting as I yelled and cried. This have never happened before. Then a drawing of a door appears on the floor next to her. I felt something really bad was gonna happen so I finally got myself out of it and woke up. I then heard my actual mother wake up about 2 minutes after I did. 

Does anyone know what this might mean? This is the most weirdest sleep paralysis dream or experience I’ve ever had. I never lifted from my bed before and I never ever dream of someone I know of when in this state. Normally I feel chocked or just an overall heavy dark presence or entity is on me but this time it was my mom sitting in a chair next to my bed holding my hand but her smile was clearly evil. And the door on the floor freaked me out more. I at first thought it was my brain trying to create my closet cause I leave that light on so there’s always a door with light behind it but this door was on the floor in front of my closet.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi everyone!!

I was just wondering if this happens to anyone.

During sleep paralysis I don’t hallucinate. It feels like my limbs are just extremely heavy. Like there’s a general heaviness everywhere. It’s not that I suddenly can’t move, I just feel too weak to move. Almost like I’m lazy. I never really try to move because I honestly feel like it’s just not possible. I’m also really tired during this time so I can’t really feel anxious. It’s like I’m telling my body to move but it won’t so I just lay there. 

The way I get out of it is just by accepting it and “waking up” a few minutes later. By that point the anxiety takes over because I have health anxiety and start wondering if I had a stroke lol.

Also, I tend to get weird symptoms in my chest especially if I’m laying on my front. My heart rate just gets faster and faster until it feels like it’s fluttering. It feels insanely fast like 400 beats per minute. It almost feels as though it isn’t pumping. When it feels the fastest that’s when I feel paralyzed. I can’t yell for help and I can’t move. I also feel a sudden pressure in my ear. When I get out of SP my heart rate is normal (a little high because I’m anxious but other than that, normal).

Anyone else deal with similar symptoms?

Sleepparalysis,"I've had SP a couple times, but I can only clearly remember one of these. This is a pretty short story, but I thought, why not share it anyway?

So, this was back when I had a bunk-bed and I was on the top bunk. I opened my eyes to see a creepy figure on the ceiling right above me, grinning. It had long, black hair dangling down and covering some of its face. Since I was (obviously) in a sleepy state, not fully thinking, I assumed for a second that it was my sister. So, I thought ""\[her name\]?"" but realized I couldn't say it out loud, or move at all. At this same time, I also remembered that my sister was at college, so there was no way it was her. I then recalled what SP is and knew that it was what was happening. I'm lucky to have known about SP before experiencing it so that I understood what was going on. It was still very scary, though!

The next few nights after this, I entered SP again, but I began to notice the sensation that happened to me when it started. I closed my eyes as to not see anything scary and I am very glad I did!

Sleepparalysis,"   Hello, I have trouble sleeping. 
I am 19 years old, and going to bed is the worst part of my day and I don’t have anyone to really talk to about this, so I am here. 
   I’ve been dealing with sleep paralysis since I was about 10 years old and Ive never really did anything about it but now it is seriously starting to effect my mental health and I just need to tell someone about what I have to deal with because I’ve tried to tell my parents but they tell me to, “put the weed down.” Last night I was watching my YouTube videos trying to peacefully fall asleep and as I drifted off I could feel something in my room and still hear my YouTube videos playing. Since I frequently deal with this I already knew what was going on, I tried to talk or yell for my mom and like usual its like someone has my mouth duct taped. I look to my window and see a dark woman with long hair looking at me. I’m kind of a stubborn bastard so I tried to talk again to say “fuck you” or something along those lines but I managed to just barely lift my middle finger lol. But my technique to get out of this paralysis phase I just close my eyes. After a while of forcing my eyes closed while I feel this entity hanging over me I drift off and “wake up” I get my movement back get out of my bed but as soon as I walk out of my door I know I am dreaming. Now I’m very upset because I just want peaceful sleep. I try banging my head on a counter, didn’t work, tried closing my eyes again but now all I see is my eyelids. So I figured whatever I’m stuck in this dream world, I walk downstairs and many people I know are in my driveway. I figured I try to ask one of them to slap me lol, again no pain no progress. I go for a walk down my street and feel that entity again run into my house. I sprint to my door and my best friend appears and says “he’s here” It’s this man I’ve never seen in my life and he goes to attack me but my buddy smashes him in the head. As this guy has a hole in his head, he looks at me and says this is just the beginning and tears his skin off revealing just a skull. I start bashing his head in and all of a sudden I’m back in my bed about 35 minutes into my video. It lasted 35 MINUTES, but felt an eternity.

Sleepparalysis,"So a few minutes ago I fell asleep while doing homework, and after a few mins I could here talking- like an entire crowd of people talking over each other. I kept my eyes closed for a few seconds until I realized what I was hearing and opened my eyes. I opened my eyes and nobody was there, ""WTF,"" I thought. I then tried to move and noticed that I couldn't, now I was freaking out. THEN my entire body felt tingly, kinda like when your leg or smth falls asleep, except extremely watered down and on my whole body. I started to breathe out of my mouth and then everything stopped. I calmed down and thought maybe that it was just a one off thing. So then I get back to homework and start dozing off again. This time I started to hear a few people talking instead of a croud, I didn't hear it all but it was smth like ""They __________ in your ear."" Again I was able to wake up by breathing out of my mouth.
Now I was curious, so I purposely let it happen this time. This time I only heard one voice, unfortunately I don't remember what it said but it was smth along the lines of ""It's going to drink you."" Then I felt like a straw had been stuck into my back and I was being dranken by a creature of some sort! I was able to wake myself up the same way as before.

Keep in mind each time my body felt tingly and I couldn't move. I also felt more vulnerable, like I could die easily. I also feel like I should mention that it was daylight during this.

Sleepparalysis,"I'm new here so if this doesn't fall under this catagory  then I'm sorry.

I'd like your opinion about what happened to me.

Little backround:

Last night I was at my parents house with my brother and we slept in the same room. The room isn't very big. I have a problem falling asleep (it takes me almost 40+ min to fall a sleep) but I'm a deep sleeper. 

I was sleeping and suddenly I felt like someone was watching me. I was extremly scared to open my eyes. It was a fear like I never have expirienced. I rolled my hand to a fist, ready to punch, I opened my eyes and I froze. I saw a tall shadow right next to me. It was looking at my stomach. Then he moved his hands (also very long) to my stomach and my whole body had extreme chils and he faded away. At the moment the fear went away and I started to think if this was sleep paralysis. But what I read about it before the nigh, it sound like you can't move at all, but I could. As i was thinking about it I look at the chimney (it's in the middle of the wall) I see another shadow and the fear comes back. I could't move, it faded away and the extreme chils came back. When it faded away the fear went also. I took my phone and look at the time, it was 6 am. I look around the room with phone's light and see nothing. I try to fall asleep but then the odd feeling like some ones watching me comes back. I open my eyes and it goes away. It happened several times after that.

Right now I'm back at my house. If I expirience something like it here too then I will write about it here.

I'd like to hear your opinion on it because I haven't expirienced sleep paralysis and I would like to know if it was it or not.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi everyone! 

I occasionally get these weird symptoms during sleep paralysis and I don’t know what they are. It always happens when I’m laying on my front (so I can hear/feel my heartbeat on the mattress).

During these episodes (where I’m half asleep), it feels like my heart rate is slowly rising and beating irregularly until it gets to impossible levels of speed. It literally feels like my heart is trembling. It’s not pounding, it feels like it’s fluttering at over 300 beats per minute. During this time I feel like I can’t move.

I’m thinking it could be some sort of hypnagogic hallucination?

I should stress that I’m very healthy. 17 years old and very active. I don’t have sleep apnea.

I do have health anxiety and it’s a possibility that falling asleep and feeling my heartbeat against the mattress is tricking me into thinking my heart is beating wildly.

Honestly I’m a bit worried about SVT or PSVT.

Sleepparalysis,"In the past few days i had weird,scary dreams, they were unusually intense, long, very eventful and they were about the things that bother me subconscious.

The first one , i forgot what was this exactly about, but later in my dream i dreamed multiple times that i lost control somehow, i was falling out of my bed(it seemed totally real), later i texted in my phone about scary things, and the whole time i felt like i wanted to wake up but i couldn't, like my mind was under some kind of surface.

I woke up paranoid because i felt that the eyes in my room,example: eyes in the cover of books, little decorations with eyes, that they are watching me and as soon as i woke up i started to take all of them to the trash because i was so terrified from them for no reason, i felt like i was being watched by them.

Now the weird thing is, the web search in my dream didnt happend in reality. 

An another dream:
Today i had a long intense dream, then..i am in my room again, i am laying in my bed the exact same position as i sleep. (I am sleeping in a higher position with my pillow, so i am able to see my room in a better view),
And like an octopus legs, but scarier, they were the end of my bed, near my leg, BUT i was able to make them go away, then i got frozen for a few seconds and i could feel some weird hairy thing on my throat, it was so scary and disguisting, and i could only feel it not see it, but it felt real.
Then i woke up. But it felt like i woke up because i was really trying to.

I have a history of weird sleep experiences.
Where i woke up confusiod, and i was crying, feeling deeply delpressdd for no reasom, imagining things, like a serial killer is searching after me, and totally confused i went back to sleep.

And the most scarier i had, actually two.
Like the recent ones. My dream was in the exact same position as i was sleeping in my bed.  Stuffed animals, spoons random things started flowing in the air, and i could feel a presence of a dead loved one of mine.
I couldn't move and i was absolutely terrified.

Few days later, exactly similar with different view.
I was facing with my cabinet, but the cabinet door was open and again, a stuffed animal was floating there.
Again, i was unable to move and i felt terrified.

Sorry for my english, i am very tired since i am avoiding sleep..
So the only thing that makes me question sleep paralysis, that i am not always paralyised. And i am scared i might developing it?

Sleepparalysis,"I’m 19 years old and I’ll begin where I believe what caused me to have sleep paralysis. I was 4 years old at the time and my cousin showed me one those jump scare  daemon ghost videos on YouTube. It traumatized me. For months after i just had this fear that I was going to see what I say in that video in real life. 

My first time experiencing sleep paralysis.
I was about 7 years old and at night I would always have these demonic thoughts at the same time every night. But this night was different. As I was having these thoughts I began to hear a slight ringing in my ear. (come to find out the ringing was tinnitus and I’ve had it ever since that night). I noticed that thinking about paranormal things was making the ringing more intense, and then something happened that will change my life forever. Suddenly the ringing got got piercing loud and my body went completely numb. I began to hear voices screaming in my ears, I could feel hands grabbing my body and pulling me around. I was trying to move around and scream for help but I was completely paralyzed. It was psychological hell. Then about 30 seconds later it all ended. 

Throughout my life I noticed that when I was in times of depression these things would happen more frequently. They began happening in lucid dreams which was exactly like everything I described above but being stuck in a dream fully awake but completely paralyzed. They would also happen when I was in and out of REM sleep, I would hear the ringing and eventually I knew that the ringing would cause me to go into sleep paralysis. Sometimes I would be in REM sleep with my eyes open and I would have these crazy demonic hallucinations being paralyzed but also aware of what was happening. The best way I can describe it is like being in a coma that you can still hear your surroundings but unable to respond. 

The most terrifying experience I’ve had. 
(Note my papa died 6months before this happened) I had fallen asleep around 5pm and I knew I shouldn’t have because sometimes I would fall asleep around this time and I would have these experiences but I was tired and didn’t care.So I fall asleep and start having this dream. In those dream I was in my grandparents living room talking with my papa, cousin and grandma. My papa had this glowing good aura around him and the room semmed so vibrant. My papa said something to me and I responded, my cousin looked at me weird and said who are you talking too, I look back to where my papa was sitting and he wasent actually there. As i realized it my dream took a very monochrome look and they both started crying because I was talking to my dead papa. This was only the beginning.(NOTE EVERYTHING IM ABOUT TO SAY ALL HAPPENED IN A DREAM BUT TO ME IT WAS AS REAL AS THE THINGS SURROUNDING YOU THE READER) I opened my eyes and I felt like I was falling in and out of consciousness. I was looking around the room banging against the walls I knew that I had fallen into a sleep paralysis dream. I grabbed my phone but when I looked at it I didn’t understand anything I was seeing on the screen so I tried using my Siri to call my brother to come wake me up. I pick up my phone and I see a figure on the bottom of the screen where my reflection of my face was it had black eyes black nose and a black mouth with a white face screaming at me. My body felt like it had 1000 pounds of weight all over it I was unable to move but I rolled over and was able to look out my door and I saw my brother standing there but I was unable to ask him for help I couldn’t talk I couldn’t move and then I had fallen on to the floor terrified I began to try to move around and make the experience stop but struggling to move was only making the experience more intense I began to hear piercingly loud screaming as I was trying to move I was using every fiber of my being just to try to move a muscle. As I was doing this it felt like vibrations were streaming through my body it felt like another entity had grabbed a hold of my soul and was trying to pull me out of my body strangely somehow I was also able to be sitting watching this happen. I was hearing screaming it feel like things were grabbing my body scratching me pulling on me and still I was unable to move in the experience would just continue eventually I was able to make a muscle in my lower back twitch and it was just enough to wake me up out of the experience.

Sleepparalysis,"I've never looked into it, i just knew i had it. Started when i was about 10. 28 now.   
What prompted me too look more into it now is because it's been happening more frequently.   
It happened last night, and funny thing is, i had just watched a video before i went to bed talking about WILD (Wake-Induced Lucid Dreaming) and i was like hey, maybe that's what i'm doing on accident lol  


Mine are usually weird, and i dont know how to explain it, but a majority of mine are feeling like i'm moving, when i'm not. For example, the one from last night, i felt like i was swinging my legs side to side, but i could look down and see my legs, and see i wasn't moving. The one a few days ago, i felt like i was either being pulled or sliding towards the foot of the bed, but i could clearly see i wasn't. Most of these, i have \*almost\* complete control over what i can do, i just cant stop the episode. Almost every time it the same environment i went to sleep in, so i'm not sure if i'm just asleep and vividly recreating my bedroom in my dream, or awake, and in some mixed reality type of state. It's super vivid, down to the netflix show i have on when i go to sleep. At this point, after having so many, i just realize whats going on, and know it'll pass soon, so i don't even freak out anymore, unless i have hallucinations.  


There has been a few times i've had hallucinations as well. Right after my great grandmother died, there was a night where i knew i was about to have another episode (i can ""guess"" when im about to have one, because it's usually right after i suddenly wake up and try to go back to sleep) and i looked over, and my great grandmother was just sitting on the bed, staring at me. i knew it was a hallucination, but they're still creepy and terrifying lol   


the other hallucinations are very similar to what i see from people on here. Regular SP episode, and then a shadowy figure standing there. I remember the first time it happened when i was 10. I remember it because it hadn't happen before, it felt like i just woke up, and i went to get out of bed and i couldn't.   


It seems as i've gotten older, they started happening more frequently. Most of them now are what i believe to be neurological hallucinations (not even sure if thats a thing) as they involve what i mentioned in the beginning, the feeling of moving when i can clearly see i'm not. I haven't seen anyone else talk about it along the same lines as i experience it though, so if anyone has any similar experiences, let me know.",t2_u7h7f,0,SP for 18 years,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,ysi5ku,True,Dappthekid,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/ysi5ku/sp_for_18_years/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/ysi5ku/sp_for_18_years/,52854.0,1668190280,0,,False,1668190290,1669822652,2022-11-11 18:11:20,,,,,,,,,
Sleepparalysis,"Hi, this is my first post on here. I don’t experience sleep paralysis often, in fact this is only my second time experiencing it. I’m a 22 year old woman who lives at home with her parents and sibling. The first time was one during a scary dream where it was nighttime and I was in the passenger seat with my sister driving the car down a dark road in the middle of the night. 

We saw someone in the middle of the road so we stopped and I leaned forward to open the glove compartment when l suddenly froze because I felt like someone was right beside me but I couldn’t see them, just feel it because the energy was very off and strong and I couldn’t turn, move, or scream. That was my first sleep paralysis experience and I didn’t like it. 

Today I woke up earlier than usual and i didn’t have any classes or anything so after a couple of hours I decided to take a small nap that lasted less than an hour, maybe about 30mins? So the dream started off normal but weird vibes, don’t remember too much except that I was with my parents in a town over because they wanted to purchase some land there and decided to also purchase a store/restaurant there too. We went in and for some reason I was topless but no one commented but I felt uncomfortable and I just sat at the computer with my back to people. 

I had a conversation with the owners son about how now that my parents are buying the store, he can go to college at the one I went to and I said I went there and liked it as well. I walked off after this but I can’t remember anything after this, I think my boyfriend came and put a jacket around my shoulders at some point? I don’t know. 

The sleep paralysis was after this and started off dark I think, I know I was hearing my boyfriend’s voice and I felt like we were having sex but then I think I somehow recognized that the “audio” was from “the last time we had sex.” I can’t be too sure if it actually was from a past time, but dream me somehow realized that it wasn’t actually happening so I opened my eyes and I was on my side in my bed and I felt like someone was behind me. 

I could see that my closet was right in front of me, I usually keep a pile of clothes on my bed and I recognized a brown sweater I own being on top of the pile. I felt movement behind me and an arm was over my waist and I tightly grabbed what felt like a finger from a hand as it tried to pull away before just accepting that I had a grip on it. I tried to turn to see who was behind me by looking over my shoulder but I couldn’t turn my head fully, just kind of got maybe 90° at the most because I could only see my ceiling fan and top of my mirror on my dresser because beyond that was just black. 

I tried really hard to turn my head further and the black border just kinda twitched a bit as I strained and then I just woke up. I’m feeling very disturbed, in a different way than what I felt after the first experience. I just wanted to see who it was. Realistically, I know it wasn’t really anyone because I was home alone when it happened. But it just felt so real, I feel disturbed that I couldn’t see who or what it was. 

I would appreciate any comments or maybe explanations or anything really. Thank you so much for reading.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve had sleep paralysis for about 7ish years. I can’t recall when or why it started exactly but there have been periods of time in those years when it’s especially bad. Like getting it every night for months bad and then it just vanishes for another few months to years. I’ve been trying to pay more attention to what’s going on in the day before I get it.  For me I’ve realized thinking about sleep paralysis, reading about it, or talking about it triggers me to definitely having it that night. It’s the only guaranteed time I’ll have it. 

It’s hard because even a light thought of, “hope I don’t get SP” before going to bed will mean I get it. If I don’t think about it before bed, I won’t have it so I’ve started to read a lot before I sleep to help prevent it for myself.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi. I've been having issues sleeping lately, trying to sleep, day or night.

I'm on several medications including oxy, amitriptyline, baclofen. And I more often than not take 5 or 6 tylenol pm to help me sleep aswell as help with pain in my back and pancreas. That's everything I'm taking into account anyways. 

So I'm laying trying to sleep, and I honestly begin to feel a presence with me sometimes watching me, or just in the vasinity of the house. Sometimes I feel like it's even in me or on me. I've felt as though I get touched and honestly I'm scared i am scared to try and sleep. I notice it far more when I don't take tylenol pm, however taking tylenol pm just intensifies the feelings and makes it harder to react because I'm so groggy and just want to sleep.

I've left movies on the last 2 nights at a low volume so I can hear it and have the lights on but even still I get that horrible feeling. I've tried relaxing my mind because I know it's gotta just be all in my head. Because  my thoughts start to race and every sound I hear freaks me out. 

I feel like my sleep is haunted or cursed to be honest......and I'm now afraid to sleep/ even the night tbh. I've always loved sleeping in the silence, the peace and quiet, so sleeping with the TV on sucks, I hate it.

I live alone also and I have been for the last 8 years. I've loved it, I've never had sleep terrors that I know of. I've had nightmares etc etc, however they've never phased me, I just acknowledge I'm dreaming  and wake up and fall back to sleep.

However I've felt being touched and I'm afraid to just let the feeling and thoughts play out because I'm afraid of what will happen if I do and honestly scared whatever it is will hurt me and or is evil.

I'm not religious  however I've always believed in a God and I believe in spirits as I've experienced alot of inexplicable things that is another post all of its own. But  has anyone else experienced such things? What do I do? Is there a medication to take that will help or get rid of this feeling? Do I need to talk to a therapist? Do I need an exorcism of my house / or myself? Is what's happening to me mental or spiritual, something that'll pass or is just evil?

Sleepparalysis,"i think this will be more of a vent than anything, as i (21F) have just had my first SP experience (i think). 

so i’ll start from the beginning as to why i think this may be a dream and not SP. my boyfriend (23M) has had sleep paralysis many times in the past, his most recent episode being last Saturday where i actually witnessed him having an episode. after that, we talked extensively about theories surrounding sleep paralysis, reading studies about it, etc. 

well today, i was taking a short nap and i had a very vivid dream about something traumatic that happened to my family. after this, i woke up, and tried to go back to sleep. as i was sleeping, i felt like i kept hearing noises (i’m home alone during this). the first noise being a cell phone ringing that sounded like my dads phone, i ignored it, and tried to sleep. i hear another noise that sounds like footsteps. i open my eyes, which for some reason is incredibly hard to do and it almost felt like i was fighting to open them. i’m laying on my side facing the wall, the door is on the adjacent wall. the footsteps were getting closer and closer, so i look in the corner of my and am straining to see the door, where it is wide open. i’m starting to panic at this point and try to move to look closer and see what’s there, but my body physically will not move. no matter how hard i try, i can’t move my neck even a little bit to see what’s there. at this point, there is a dark figure there and i can just see upper body of a figure. my heart is racing and i’m full on terrified that this figure is about to get to me. i close my eyes, and then eventually wake up and i can move again. 

this seems to fit the marks for sleep paralysis, and my boyfriend agrees (and feels super bad as if he caused it lol), but i’m skeptical that this may have been just a nightmare considering we recently talked about it. the whole experience was pretty short, about 45 seconds probably. it’s crazy that i felt as if it took so much work to just open my eyes, but i’m not even sure that that happened. i didnt necessarily feel that i couldn’t breathe, but my body definitely felt heavy and i could not move.  i cant tell if my brain was just telling me not to move because i was having a nightmare and it was telling me to stay still and pretend to sleep to make the creature go away, or if this really was SP.

Sleepparalysis,"Hey eveyone! I just found this sub recently, which has inspired me to share my own personal experiences with SP.

I understand that sleep paralysis differ alot from person to person, and so far i havn't found anyone that experience it exactly the same as i do.  the thing is, i pretty much only have sleep paralysis in the morning, usually after atleast 6 hours of sleep. and it only happens if my brain manages to wake up a little and start to think about stuff before going back to sleep .  in contrast to just falling right back to sleep - in which case it nothing happens.  

Now for the actual experiences. I can usually feel the paralysis coming on as a light buzzing in my body, but if i move my body before it gets to me i snap out of it.   if i let i get to me however,  i will feel completely paralyzed and like i can't breath..then the loud noises start. it sounds like a humming that eventually turn into the sound of wheezing train tracks and human screams, and then this irrational terror rushes over me, as if i'm being watched by some horrible evil entity. usuallly i'm not actually seeing anything, it's just a feeling. but  i get super anxious of what i might see when i open my eyes. Thankfully, i always snap out of it the moment i manage to open my eyes.    on rare occasions i have hallucinated some grim images in my head, while sleep paralysided, but it's usually not a visual experience for me.

Sleepparalysis,"So I’ve been having night mares for the for the past 4 nights in a row and usually when I get nightmares they turn into lucid dreams but I notice when I lucid dream too much they turn into this weird thing where I get stuck but not full on paralyzed.

Sleepparalysis," I started having sleep paralysis regularly after the first time i broke through on dmt. i feel like i definitely wasnt ready to see beyond the vail yet and i had no idea how to protect myself from entitys.  I had sleep paralysis nearly every night for about a year, there were 3 major episodes that really stuck with me.  This one night i woke up in sleep paralysis, but at first i was like ‘cool its a free trip’ as the walls around me were turning into crazy kaleidoscope patterns and portals. I could slightly move my body at this stage and felt no fear, i looked down the side of my bed and saw an angry demon like face on my floor, i was just like ‘dont look there’ and kept looking around at everything else, i could move my arms and hands and picked up my phone, the characters on my wallpaper were dancing around my screen, i then moved my leg and something grabbed it, it was invisible and i couldnt see what it was. As soon as it grabbed me it sent me into proper sleep paralysis where i couldnt breathe, felt like i was being choked and couldnt move my body as this thing dragged me accross my bed. (This was when i lived in my mums tiny shed, my bed was infront of these shelves on the wall and this one dark empty space below them where I kept some things) this entity dragged me into the dark space under the shelves next to my bed and pulled down my pants trying to rape me. At this point i was screaming ‘wake up , wake up, wake up, wake up!’ And i managed to force myself awake before anything happened.  Another night, i was sleeping in my car with my boyfriend at the time at our friends property. I went to sleep and woke up in a dream where i was in a dark room, ballroom dancing with this tall being wearing a black robe and it had a skull mask on that was, the best way i can describe it, half water buffalo half bird.  As i was dancing with this being i thought ‘what the hell is going on right now?!’ And i said outloud ‘oh! Im dreaming!’ This thing didnt like that i knew this and gave me an evil look, touched me in the middle if my neck and entered into me through my neck, sent me into sleep paralysis where i felt like i was being choked, couldnt breathe and couldnt move as this thing was inside me attacking my spin, it was flying up and down my spine inside of me. Eventually it left me and i just lay there thinking ‘what the fuck… don’t go back to sleep it can’t get you if you’re not asleep. Then from being awake it entered into me again through my neck into my spine attacking my spine, while it put me back into sleep paralysis, it eventually left me again and i just lay there for the rest of the night terrified to be awake or asleep.  The last time i ever really remember this happening, i was sleeping in my mums shed, i woke up in sleep paralysis, i couldnt move, breathe and felt like i was being choked when this entity presented itself to me as this fat indian man (similar looking to my old boss who would touch my butt at work) he stretches my legs open and was about to rape me, i screamed ‘wake up, wake up, wake up!!!’ But it didnt work, i didnt know what to do i couldnt wake up and he was about to rape me so i just tried to imagine i had a giant fist where my vagina was, and it worked and imagined myself punching him with it, and it worked, he fell back and i imagined an army of people around me and imagined them beating the shit out of him and it worked.  After that night i realised my true powers and nothing has ever been able to fuck with me again since.",t2_u48q3gkh,0,Sleep paralysis episodes with male succubus (Incubus),[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,yrc0u4,True,poop_girl6,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/yrc0u4/sleep_paralysis_episodes_with_male_succubus/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/yrc0u4/sleep_paralysis_episodes_with_male_succubus/,52839.0,1668079522,0,,False,1668079535,1669823082,2022-11-10 11:25:22,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"And now I have an objective verification of it.

So I usually get sleep paralysis episodes about once or twice a week, and at times they feel really, really long. Half an hour to an hour at times. Because they are relatively frequent and I'm not usually panicking while having them, I managed to make a number of interesting observations.

1) Factors that increase the likelihood and length of the sleep paralysis episodes are: 

* Feeling tired (usually by sleeping poorly at night).
* Sleeping on my back.
* Sleeping with any kind of disturbance (such as light, sound or people talking/walking around me). 

2) My hallucinations are usually divided into distinct categories:

* Presence hallucinations/delusions (such as my dad walking outside my room, my cat lying on my chest, my mom sitting next to me, etc.) 
* Hallucinations related to movement (I get up or fall off the bed and then find myself back in bed, for instance). 
* Tactile hallucinations (such as feeling the actual fall off the bed plus the pain involved). 
* Scary hallucinations/delusions (such as believing that my spine is broken hence I'm paralyzed).

3) I can control certain parts of my body slightly, such as the tips on my fingers and toes, my lips and tongue, my eyes, and my breathing. 

I have proof because I once fell asleep on my chair with my feet on the bed, and by moving my toes the right way I managed to tilt my legs out of balance which caused me to fall off my chair and wake up from the paralysis. 

Another example is when my fingers are on my thigh, and then I manage to move my hand a long way. At the moment I move my fingers, my hand instantly ""jumps"" and reappears back on my thigh. Because my brain felt the tactile sensation, it realized that it made a mistake, and immediately ""fixed"" the error by making my hand reappear in the right position.

4) I cannot wake myself up by trying to move, by trying to concentrate and then move, by trying to hold my breath and increase my heartbeat, or by hyperventilating. No matter how relaxed or anxious I am. 

5) I can remember who I am and understand my situation (minus the hallucinations) enough to do arithmetic calculations in my head, but I get the answers wrong.

6) My episodes can last more than 15 minutes (now I'll tell you how I know).

Until today I didn't manage to measure the length of my episodes because they usually came unexpectedly and I didn't have a camera or a stopwatch ready. When I get a long episode, I usually ask ""was it really THAT long, or did it simply feel that way to me?"". 

Today I fell asleep afternoon after not managing to sleep much the previous night. At some point, my cousin called his cat from the room next to mine while I was sleeping on my side, which woke me up, causing me to enter a sleep paralysis episode. I tried everything, moving, screaming, concentrating and relaxing before trying to move gently, breath holding, fast breathing, jolting my toes, everything you might think of, and nothing worked. I hallucinated that his cat went under my blanket. While I was going through the episode I had the idea of asking when he called his cat as soon as I managed to get up. When I finally did, I asked my mom and cousin when he called his cat. They said it was at least 15-30 minutes ago, hence I FINALLY got an objective estimate of the time.

Sleepparalysis,My one and only experience with sleep paralysis was when I opened my eyes one night and saw this mechanical thing in my room. The closest things I could compare it to would be the Martian probe from the old war of the worlds movie. It had a “head” on the end of a long articulating neck. It was materializing from the space between my bedroom door jamb and the ceiling. I didn’t see any type of eye or I guess camera but I had the distinct feeling it was observing me. It quickly became aware of me being awake and retracted backward dissolving into the wall. At this point I sat up in bed unsure of what I saw.

Sleepparalysis,"The other night I had my first sleep paralysis experience. I had read about this phenomena before and found it interesting, but had never experienced it myself...until now. I am 39 years old and currently 30 weeks pregnant with my 4th child. I do not own any pets, and my 3 children were asleep in their rooms.

I was dreaming I was asleep in my bed, in the same position I was actually asleep in, on my side facing the middle of the bed. The dream felt so real. My room looked the same. Nothing felt out of place. I felt the presence of something behind me, watching me. I could hear either low breathing or a growl. I could not open my eyes to see it, but it had the presence of something really tall standing by the bed. I tried to reach my arm behind me to the edge of the bed to feel what or who was there. Some invisible force prevented my arm from actually reaching behind me.

Sleepparalysis,"So I've had SP since I was about 13 so I know how it works. I even have to explain it to my dad when he says :"" isn't it just a very realistic dream?""
No dad, it isn't.

Anyway, a few nights ago I had a very strange, what seems to like SP, experience.

Usually, I either wake up in SP, ot fall into it. And when I'm falling into it I can usually tell. It's like all my limbs go numb and there's this huge magnet underneath me.

But this time, I didn't feel this. I juet felt like my body was too tired to move (and I'm still not sure if that's the case, or if i was UNABLE to move them) and instead of hallucinations (what i usually have) I fell into a strange dreaming pattern. The kind of dreams where you lose your grip on reality and don't know anymore if it's real or if you're dreaming and still in bed.
I ended up hyperventilatijg which made my boyfriend wake me up, and it still took around 4 seconds for me to be able to move my body again. I fell asleep again and I fell into the same pattern about 4-5 times. It was very frustrating because everytime, I didn't know if I had really woken up this time or if I was still in my bed (all while feeling both. So i felt that i was in my bed but at the same time, it felt as if I was actually awake and my day had started).

Anyone else ever has this or knows if this is SP?

Sleepparalysis,"I've had sleep paralysis since I was a child. First time I remember it I was about five. It's only happened a few times where I get into a terrifying cycle of sleep paralysis within a single evening, and it happens upon trying to fall asleep. Last night was one of those nights. I woke up at 2am, helped my daughter as she is sick, then tried to sleep. I began the usual sleep paralysis spiral, feeling like someone was choking me, hearing screams all around me and like my body was being shaken violently. I don't get scared because I know what's up. I wait it out and ""awaken"". 30 seconds later I begin to drift off, and it happens again. And again. And again. I even tried to stay awake but I guess my body was too close to sleep, so I went into sleep paralysis anyways with my eyes open (or I assume they were. Perhaps I was hallucinating/dreaming). I had to sit up and slap the shit outta myself to stop it from occurring again, and didn't go to sleep until 5:30 am.

Sleepparalysis,"I think i could have even tried being in lucid dreaming if i actually could tried a little harder. But overall its pretty painful to have sleep paralysis since head hurts in sp. Maybe thats why i didnt keep trying too much.

So it was a bit strange since i did have a feeling flying but my eyesight didnt change. I actually can close my eyes and feel like my body start floating. 

Also hot to describe it properly when i started to float i moved a little bit forward and then i dived through bed and somehow i felt like i was in space. For some moments. Since it was happening while my eyes were closed.

But when i open this feeling erases. But sp didnt. For me its more like about make move your body to wake up from it. Cause my sp are mostly before falling asleep and i have barely control of my body.

But still the frightening feel is now so unreal that it doesnt seem that i even got scared after it. More like stunned. But thats maybe cause i had quite a decent amount of them. Also i almost had one a week ago. It seems i have harder times.

Also little tip to some people with similar paralysis. If u want sleep dont go immediately for sleeping.

At the end I remember being in a room on a bed. Sleeping in the same position I had fell asleep in irl. There was someone who I couldnt see sitting on my back and another person watching. I remember the other person had something in his hands like a gun or a camera. At this point I was fully aware I was dreaming but couldnt move a single muscle. I felt trapped and scared. I tried to move anything. The only thing I could do was breathe heavily in and out of my nose. My only thought was you have to wake up.

Immediately after I thought that I noticed I could hear a weird buzzing. It started high pitched and it's frequency would change between two pitches. It sounds like WohWohWohWoh but imagine the "" Woh""s dropping in pitch to a very low and slower WooohWoooh. At this my anxiety and fear absolutely skyrocketed for no real reason so I tried screaming for my GF and I couldn't even whisper. I remember what my GF did and i said the same words that my GF did, "" IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST I DEMAND YOU TO LEAVE"" and I woke from my paralysis. I cried and held her.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve got sleep paralysis since I was a young kid. It would come and go, so often that I knew what it was.

I could never fully embrace it, I always fought it Because of the Closter phobic feeling it gives me.

I never saw anything during these episodes sometimes it feels like I’m sinking into my bed and suffocating, but usually I’m just paralyzed with a weird electrical vibration going through my brain.

Every time I fell asleep last night it would happen over and over again. Last night I managed to open up my eyes, the windows in my house were open and that almost full moon made it able to see in the dark living room.

There was a cocoon looking thing hanging from the ceiling and I saw a shadow figure run away for my vision.

I always thought I’d be terrified if I saw something like that but I was just pissed and I started cursing at it telling it to quit running show itself!

Sleepparalysis,"On Saturday night, I experienced my first scary experience with sleep paralysis. I've tried talking to my husband and a friend about it but they don't seem to care haha so figured I'd try talking about it here. 

I knew that I have strange experiences while sleeping every once in a while but most of the time they just make me laugh the following morning and I don't think about them again. I'm also someone who has random health problems and lately seizures have been on my mind due to some things I have going on.

So Sunday afternoon, I laid down in my bed because I was starting to get a headache and I was very tired feeling. Then all of a sudden I vividly remembered what happened the night before. I remember that I woke up and it felt like my head was vibrating, and then it moved to my whole body. There was also a buzzing noise that would get louder as these vibrations moved down my body. I tried waking my husband up because I thought I was having a seizure. I was able to move my arm just a tiny bit, but it took so much effort! I tried to say his name, but only a whisper came out. Then the vibrating a buzzing stopped, and I must have fallen back to sleep. I woke up again with the same thing, still tried but failed to wake my husband up. I think that happened a total of 3 times. I remember being so scared and helpless.

As these memories came flooding back, I continued to think it was a seizure especially since I had a headache (yeah I know I'm dramatic). But as I googled seizures, it didn't match up. I finally searched ""waking up with head vibrating"" and that's how I came to realize it was sleep paralysis. Despite it being normal and unconcerning, I cant get past the fear I felt!  I know people have far scarier experiences with it and I'm grateful this was all I had, but not knowing what was happening (also assuming it was a seizure) made it really scary. 

So anyway that is my first experience with this and those of you that have to face scarier things with sleep paralysis, I'm so sorry!

Sleepparalysis,"Its almost as if something in my room is charging up to a blast, like im in this magnetic field. And when the sounds and vibrations reach a sort of ""limit"", this crazy digital blast sound occur. And normally when I feel and hear the charging/vibrations, I back out of falling asleep because I get so scared/uncomfortable. If i'm letting the blast happen I usually get into sleep paralysis. Last night, after waking up at 3am, this happened to me like 10 times. Meaning I couldnt fall back to sleep at all.

Sleepparalysis,"According to some accounts, people who encountered this entity claims that the Hatman introduce himself to them as THE DEVIL (in their native languange) 


I want to draw your attention to these verses in the Bible.


In James 2:19 says even demons believe. 


James 2:19 


You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder. 


The Hatman is known throughout the world with two distinguishing features as his identity. the coat and the hat. 


According to verse 1 cor 11:13 


The symbol of the man's head is Christ 


1 Corinthians 11:3 


But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 


1 Cor 11:7 


A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 


The Bible says demons also believe. A man who covers his head while praying shames their head (for the man's head symbolizes Christ) covering a man's head means shaming Christ. Satan doesn't want to honor Christ and dont want to be the image of the glory of God, and this is what this entity portraying. 


1 Corinthians 11:4 


Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.


A man's head is a symbol of Christ. There is also a verse that says our bodies is the temple of God..


""Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple."" 


""Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies."" 


The Hatman's head and body were both covered (hat and coat) as if it was a message that he did not agree with it. Among the shadow people, he is the only one with this kind of details. seems like the Hatman is the one who leads and is superior to these demonic shadow people who attack through sleep paralysis, others claims that some shadow people wears cloaks. ( covering their head and body too) 


God's temple (the body) 


Christ (a man's head) 


Seems that the Hatman and his cohorts is doing the opposite to mock God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 


covering up is a form of hiding or it is something you are ashamed of. 


Remember the story of Adam and Eve? 


God made Adam and Eve naked, until Satan came and tempted the woman to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. there they found out that they were naked and ashamed, God was angry and God made them a body covering and they were expelled from the garden of Eden.


 People all over the world have seen this entity (Hatman) in Job 2:2 it says.. 


 Job 2:2 


And the Lord said to Satan, ""Where have you come from?"" Satan answered the Lord, ""From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.


God warned us about the Devil


 1 Peter 5:8


Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.


One of the Hatman's cohorts is the evil entity called Incubus who sexually assaulted women and some men during sleep paralysis. 

these demonic incubus are angels who rebelled against God and went with lucifer (Satan) They became demons and messed with people on earth. these demons were called Nephilims back in the day, who according to Bible married human daughters and gave birth to giants. the word married does not mean having the blessing of the parents but these rebel angels sexually attack the daughters of men on earth which these evil spirit incubus does in sleep paralysis. another term for them is the sex demons. 
It is not surprising why these demonic shadow people according to some people are bigger and taller in height,why? because they were the origin race of giants on earth who were destroyed by God in the flood during Noah's time.


Ever wonder why the Hatman both appears in reality and in sleep paralysis? Because Sleep paralysis isn't a dream. Sleep paralysis is a demonic power. Once you are under this spell, you will become paralyzed, unable to move and speak as if your mouth is gagged and your whole body is tied. Demons used this demonic power to people they prey on to prevent the person to  fight back during the attack. That is the truth, it has nothing to do with medical issues or medications you're taking like what these doctors claimed. 



Satan (Lucifer) and the demons have an appointed time. in fact, they  knew that God set a time to punish them. they knew that there is an appointed day for them.

 In Matthew 8:29 it says.. 

And behold, they cried out, ""What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” 


Also according to research, witnesses says that the Hatman has a pocket watch in his hand, and he often check on it as if he is waiting for something, does this mean Satan knows that his day is near? 



Revelation 12:12


Therefore rejoice, you heavens

 and you who dwell in them!

But woe to the earth and the sea,

Sleepparalysis,"According to some accounts, people who encountered this entity claims that the Hatman introduce himself to them as THE DEVIL (in their native languange) 


I want to draw your attention to these verses in the Bible.


In James 2:19 says even demons believe. 


James 2:19 


You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder. 


The Hatman is known throughout the world with two distinguishing features as his identity. the coat and the hat. 


According to verse 1 cor 11:13 


The symbol of the man's head is Christ 


1 Corinthians 11:3 


But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 


1 Cor 11:7 


A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 


The Bible says demons also believe. A man who covers his head while praying shames their head (for the man's head symbolizes Christ) covering a man's head means shaming Christ. Satan doesn't want to honor Christ and dont want to be the image of the glory of God, and this is what this entity portraying. 


1 Corinthians 11:4 


Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.


A man's head is a symbol of Christ. There is also a verse that says our bodies is the temple of God..


""Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple."" 


""Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies."" 


The Hatman's head and body were both covered (hat and coat) as if it was a message that he did not agree with it. Among the shadow people, he is the only one with this kind of details. seems like the Hatman is the one who leads and is superior to these demonic shadow people who attack through sleep paralysis, others claims that some shadow people wears cloaks. ( covering their head and body too) 


God's temple (the body) 


Christ (a man's head) 


Seems that the Hatman and his cohorts is doing the opposite to mock God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 


covering up is a form of hiding or it is something you are ashamed of. 


Remember the story of Adam and Eve? 


God made Adam and Eve naked, until Satan came and tempted the woman to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. there they found out that they were naked and ashamed, God was angry and God made them a body covering and they were expelled from the garden of Eden.


 People all over the world have seen this entity (Hatman) in Job 2:2 it says.. 


 Job 2:2 


And the Lord said to Satan, ""Where have you come from?"" Satan answered the Lord, ""From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.


God warned us about the Devil


 1 Peter 5:8


Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.


One of the Hatman's cohorts is the evil entity called Incubus who sexually assaulted women and some men during sleep paralysis. 

these demonic incubus are angels who rebelled against God and went with lucifer (Satan) They became demons and messed with people on earth. these demons were called Nephilims back in the day, who according to Bible married human daughters and gave birth to giants. the word married does not mean having the blessing of the parents but these rebel angels sexually attack the daughters of men on earth which these evil spirit incubus does in sleep paralysis. another term for them is the sex demons. 
It is not surprising why these demonic shadow people according to some accounts are bigger and tall in height, because they were the origin race of giants on earth who were destroyed by God in the flood during Noah's time.


Ever wonder why the Hatman both appears in reality and in sleep paralysis? Because Sleep paralysis isn't a dream. Sleep paralysis is a demonic power. Once you are under this spell, you will become paralyzed, unable to move and speak as if your mouth is gagged and your whole body is tied. Demons used this demonic power to people they prey on to prevent the person to  fight back during the attack. That is the truth, it has nothing to do with medical issues or medications you're taking like what these doctors claimed. 



Satan (Lucifer) and the demons have an appointed time. in fact, they  knew that God set a time to punish them. they knew that there is an appointed day for them.

 In Matthew 8:29 it says.. 

And behold, they cried out, ""What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” 


Also according to research, witnesses says that the Hatman has a pocket watch in his hand, and he often check on it as if he is waiting for something, does this mean Satan knows that his day is near? 



Revelation 12:12


Therefore rejoice, you heavens

 and you who dwell in them!

But woe to the earth and the sea,

because the devil has gone down to you!

Sleepparalysis,"   Just wanted to share this weird SP episode I had a while back. Although it happened almost a year ago, I still remember in a good amount of detail what happened because of how strange it was. I remember hanging out and having a good time with some friends in my dream, when suddenly I was in my kitchen looking out the window, admiring this strikingly orange and yellow sunset in the distance. I remember feeling like something was off, and when I looked down at the counter, I saw that I was making a banana and orange smoothie in a blender. This caught me off guard for some reason, probably because of how gross it seemed lol, and I remember stepping back before the scene changed again. At this point I was starting to become suspicious of my reality, and then I saw that I was sitting alone in my middle school classroom. Rows of empty desks surrounded me, and I noticed that on the whiteboard in front of the room there was an image being projected onto it. It looked like a barren African savanna with a bright orange sunset in the background, outcasting the silhouette of only a singe acacia tree. At this point I began to realize that I was dreaming probably from the bizarreness of everything, which at first excited me, but then my bedroom began to melt together with the classroom that I was in. I started to regain some of my bodily senses, but I was stuck, and could only move my eyes and my head slightly. I saw that both my room and the class had blended together in such a visually confusing way, it honestly overwhelmed me. Looking back, I think that my stressed state of mind may have caused the following events. I’m not sure exactly how many there were, but when I looked a bit down towards my abdomen and feet, I saw at least 5 tall and thin shadows towering around my bed. I could hear that they were all communicating with one another, but it was as if they were speaking in 2x speed, so I couldn’t even understand what they were saying. They were all speaking over each other, still fluctuating in tone and energy and seemed like they were engaging in a serious conversation, but their voices began to grow louder and louder that it began to hurt my head. I started to tell them to stop and to be quiet, not sure if I actually made any noise though, but they still just spoke at the speed of light. I now began to plead for them to stop and to just please leave me alone, and after this they all immediately bent their faces towards me at the same time. They had horizontally oval heads with grayish/brown skin and tiny, sunken eyes. Synchronously they all yelled at me, “SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP.” I shot up from my bed, beaded with sweat, and I was so shaken up that I wasn’t sure if I was still dreaming or not. Once I confirmed that I was finally awake, I could not have gone back to sleep that night even if I wanted to.

I usually hallucinate humanoid figures hovering over me/watching me from coners, but it has recently escalated to them leaping at me causing me to jump awake, and tonight actually grabbing me and dragging me around my bed.

I usually am able to go back to sleep afterwards, but tonight really triggered some anxiety, and even after 30 minutes of being awake, drinking tea, eating some food and watching some mindless tv, i can still feel my heart pumping a bit too fast.

Sleepparalysis,"This is the first time something like this has happened to me, so I'm not completely sure if it's actual sleep paralysis. Basically it was a long night where I was waking up and falling asleep many times, but one time I had my eyes open and I was giving my body the instructions to move but it just wouldn't happen. I looked around my room and saw nothing strange, but when I turned my eyes to my left (which is where a wall should be) I only saw a very dark and scary looking kind of face or figure. I couldn't get a full glance because my head wouldn't turn. I didn't feel anything on my chest or any weird sensation, just very partially seeing something demonical and not being able to move. After about 20 or 30 seconds the first thing I was able to move were my toes. I got up, let out a big sigh and after a while of struggling to fall asleep I woke up the next day like normal.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve been getting minor SP episodes for a year. Maybe more, hard to say. I’ve experienced both auditory and tactile hallucinations. This morning I had my first visual hallucination. It was super minor, I honestly can’t even remember what it was, I just know I saw something in my room “and thought that’s not really there”. But ngl, I’m a little worried about this progression. 

Now, the part I’m curious about. *Has anyone had persistent SP as they’re trying to fall back asleep?* I don’t understand this cause I thought SP happens after REM before you wake up. But I’ll wake up, look at my phone, decide I’m still tired, drift off, and then I’ll feel SP starting. It usually last only for seconds (5-30) and since I’m so used to the feeling I’m sometimes able to sort of pull myself out and wake back up. But because Ill get woke back up, Ill try to sleep more and SP will start again. I think I had it 5+ times this morning. I woke up at 4 am. I can’t just not go back to sleep but I really don’t want to cause ik I’ll have SP if I do.

Also, is there anything that can be done to make it less frequent? I have SP most days. It’s worse on weekends due to the above. Are visual hallucinations a sign it’s getting worse, or was my brain just feeling creative? Will these hallucinations become more frequent?

Sleepparalysis,"I swear i don't believe in ghost, but this year has really been a bitch for my sleep. My insomnia has gotten worse and i had a hypnopompic hallucination a couple of months ago.

For those interested i woke up to a 3-meter tall marshall looking down at me while sleeping and screamed my lungs out.

&amp;#x200B;

But this time, i'll be the first one to admit i did all the wrong things: i hate an intense workout, i had a glass of wine and ate an enormous meal. That also explained the nightmare i had. This nightmare, however, was different. I was aware that it was a nightmare, and normally i would just force myself to wake up immediately. This time, however, i just kept watching it because it was quite interesting and i wanted to see how it ended - kinda like a horror movie.

&amp;#x200B;

I then woke up because it got too scary and fell asleep again. I then gained consciousness two hours later to a woman laying herself on me, kinda like a girlfriend would, making some kind of groaning noice like she was still tired, but then began to make out with me pretty aggressively. I was kinda alright with it because i though it was my girlfriend, whom i've slept with the night before, but then i was like ""wait, that was yesterday"" so i opened my eyes and nobody was there. That was kinda spooky, so of course i wanted to get up, but she was still lying on me.

Sleepparalysis,"When I experience sleep paralysis I see two shadow figures, one I call shady and the other I call the one that thing that scares even me, shady I see when I close my eyes during the day: it's always watching what me or someone else is doing and I sometimes see it looking at a wall, it also looks more human like than TOTTSEM, with large white Glowing eyes and nothing below the knees and normal hands also they sometimes talk to me with a deep quiet and almost demonic voice and they have told me to do things that have saved myself before such as how to get out a conversation with someone who just wants to pick a fight with someone, also they started out as that voice and they always sound calm, and then their is the one that I only see during moments of sleep paralysis, their arms and legs are black spikes with the arms having smaller spike coming off of them pointing towards their shoulders, three spikes in total, they always come out of my closet and and stab hit me, they always aim for  the parts of my body were the vital organs aren't at one time it stabbed me in the bladder I peed blood the next morning, I'm a guy that has boobs for no reason at all and I hate it FYI they aren't man boobs their the kinda boobs that you would see on a woman also I was once stabbed there, but we're shady gets a role in all this is if I close and then open my eyes they appear and prevent me from being attacked also the whole time I was typing this shady was looking over my shoulder and humming, also half way through typing this shady asked me why I used my boobs as a table for my phone and I looked at them and said so I'm not looking down when typing I mean might as well use them for something, and shady made I weird noise almost like a mhm and then said noted and went back to humming.",t2_grxmhvec,0,what sleep paralysis is like for me and my daily life in response.,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,yneg95,True,CAPTAIN_DRAWKILL671,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/yneg95/what_sleep_paralysis_is_like_for_me_and_my_daily/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/yneg95/what_sleep_paralysis_is_like_for_me_and_my_daily/,52762.0,1667702347,0,,False,1667702360,1669824507,2022-11-06 02:39:07,,,,,,,,,

Sleepparalysis,"First post on sub, appreciate any help I can get with this and as to why it is happening to me. I have looked into the list of causes, and I really dont feel like any of them are relevant. No new medications, I sleep 6-8 hours consistently, no alcohol/caffeine before sleep, not depressed, no anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet I just started experiencing sleep paralysis. I did not know the name until yesterday. I'm not sure if this is how it normally goes, but I fall into a weird state where I am awake and conscious, whenever I first start to fall asleep. It happened yesterday twice, and once the day before. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the first occurrence, it felt like I was falling. I was fully conscious, my eyes were shut, but I couldnt open them no matter how hard I tried. I felt as if I was having issues breathing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, on the second overall occurrence, I was in a weird 'night-terror' (which I do not normally get), and I was in a weird situation with a friend where it was dark, they were talking to me, I wasnt able to talk. I knew I was asleep but couldnt wake up. It was very scary. This was just a nap and not a night's sleep. I woke up feeling INSANELY groggy, even though I had plenty of sleep the night before.

&amp;#x200B;

A few hours later, I am going into proper night sleep, laying with my girlfriend. Within this state, it almost felt like psychosis, which I have never experienced before. I was in bed, eyes closed, knew I was asleep, but I could hear her talking to me in a weird gibberish tone which I couldnt understand at all. I couldnt open my eyes, and it was scary. I snapped out of it and she was asleep, not making any noise.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, but this is really bothering me, especially with how new it is. I have difficulty explaining it as I forget a lot of it right after. Something I noticed was that the episodes only last a few minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Sleepparalysis,"I just kinda want to talk about my experiences right now.

I've been experiencing sleep paralysis for a few years now. At the beginning, they happened really frequently. After some time, it got better. Currently they (mostly) happen if i sleep way to much, or at weird times for multiple days. 

For me, it was mostly the same every time. I wake up in my bed, I can't move, and usually I try to ""move"" my body really suddenly so that I can get out of my paralysis. Sometimes it's easier, sometimes it's not. I never hallucinated; I just always felt really anxious that something was going to happen or that I would never get out of it. When I'm finally ""free,"" the logical thing to do is to stand up or get on my phone. I know that if I lay back down, I will go right back into paralysis. But for some reason I never listen to myself, I lay down, and I am paralyzed again. This happened basically every time.

But now, in the last year or so, I've been having some different experiences.I sometimes can't tell if I'm actually experiencing it or if I just had an actual dream about SP. I used to never hallucinate during my SP, so that just might be me hallucinating and putting it off as an actual dream.

The first time that I realized that I was (maybe) hallucinating was the morning after a SP. During the SP, I fell (or jumped) out of my bed onto the floor, so that I would break out of the paralysis. I fell from my bed (which is kind of high) right onto my knee, and then I went back to bed. If it really happened, then I would have had a bruise, but I looked the next day and nothing was there; it never happened. which really weirded me out at first.

After that, it happened multiple times that I was stuck in a loop of getting out of SP and getting ready for the day, only to wake up back in SP.

And last night I had an experience where I was just in my usual SP, was able to move one arm, and took my other arm to hit myself in the face so that I would break free of the paralysis (for whatever reason) Afterwards, it continued; I remember waking up in the morning and my mom asking if I had been in a fight since my entire face was red and bruised. But none of that happened; my face is normal, and my mom didn't ask me anything.

These experiences just kind of weird me out. Usually before and the morning after SP, my body feels weird, kind of dizzy; it's hard to describe. But before and after those experiences, which I just named, I felt normal, not really touched by them. And I also forgot about it soon after; it feels like it wasn't SP but a simple dream.

I don't really know the point of this post; I just want to share my recent experiences. It just weirds me out and annoys me that I can't say for sure whether or not I'm in SP or dreaming about SP.",t2_al60bsw8,0,Confused by my SP,[],r/Sleepparalysis,False,0.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,0.0,,text,self.Sleepparalysis,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2se19,,yn27nt,True,Amelot420,,0,True,no_ads,False,False,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/yn27nt/confused_by_my_sp/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/yn27nt/confused_by_my_sp/,52756.0,1667673157,0,,False,1667673168,1669824630,2022-11-05 18:32:37,,,,,,,,,

I kept trying to squirm away but she would ask questions like what I was looking at on my phone or who I was trying to get to.

Sleepparalysis,"This happened around 8 years ago when I was 9 or 10 so take the details with a grain of salt. Though its my most vivid memory, nothing even comes close, to the point that my only memories of what the upstairs of that house looked like is that one, I moved like a year later.

I- had just woken up and felt like I was in danger. I had no idea why, but the absolute terror I felt is probably one of the reasons it's such a vivid memory. I couldn't move, as usual with sleep paralysis. Some figure came out of my closet that faced my bed, but then I moved. I remember falling out of my bed, and stumbling and crawling to my parent's room, though my legs never held me to run. I remember looking back and seeing it in my doorway as I left the room and got into my parents, jumping on their bed and trying to yell. If no voice came out and I felt too weak to shake my parents, though I tried and poked them but never got a response. The last thing I remember is just looking at my parents and trying to yell, with no voice coming out.

I thought of it now because that feeling of yelling but making no noise was the same as the sleep paralysis I had last night. I know that I never actually got out of my bed because when I asked my parents the next day they said they never felt or heard me.

Sleepparalysis,"“Sleep paralysis is a gift, it’s the gateway to astral projection” - Joey Bada$$

I just discovered this community in Reddit and it’s my first time posting here to get some insights or comment regarding my experience.

I’m having SP frequently especially this month to the point that I’m having 3 to 5 episodes per night. Scenarios are on typical nightmare type of shit but I’m starting to have a hard time waking up from sleep compare to what I can previously. I’m trying to find a way on how I can prevent it or at least having a control through it. I was able to wake up but I’m too weak to even open my eyes which will sent me back to sleep again immediately and the nightmare I’m having on my sleep paralysis will be continued like it was some tv series episode. I found out that waking up and sitting on your bed for about a minute and drinking a water (and flipping your pillow)before going back to sleep helps preventing you from going back on sleep paralysis.

Since I’m having this shit too often, I’m slowly trying to stop counter acting with it and letting things to happen which is why I came to a conclusion that being able to control it will results on astral projection since you are able to view what’s around when your body are unconsious.

Is there anybody here that’s also trying to explore their sleep paralysis? What’s the pros and cons of this?

Reason I asked is because I cannot let go of the fact that it might lead to something dangerous. But all and all, I usually correlate this with a psychedelic trip because once you come to a panic state, that’s where the struggle begin.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi all! I just wanted to share my experience because my insomnia lately has been annoying as all hell. In the past I’ve had two bouts of full blown sleep paralysis where I have been consciously awake, but could not move. Both times happened after nightmares and it felt like I was being jumped on top of in bed until I was finally able to move around. 

That was about 6-8 years ago. Recently I have been under high amounts of stress due to finances and just life doing it’s life thing. I’m 30 and I have a hard time falling asleep/staying asleep. I’m not sure if I would call these new occurrences sleep paralysis because I am not fully awake when they happen. It’s almost as if I open my eyes for a second and my brain takes a snap shot of the last thing I saw/the position I’m laying in. That’s where it gets weird. My dreams will start to rapid fire and change constantly, each time ending with me seeing the same image of my pillow and blanket as if I had just opened my eyes again, but I can’t move and then I fall asleep again and enter a new dream sequence. 

This time around I knew that I was dreaming and each dream ended in me yelling at myself to wake up. The creepiest one being me looking at myself in the mirror and my eyes turning back and pounding on the mirror yelling at myself to wake up. The last dream after several was me feeling like my neck was being stepped on/strangled and that’s when I finally reached full consciousness and said fuck this I’ll just get out of bed now. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I’m curious if anyone else ever gets the constant flood of different dreams and can’t get out of the loop. It honestly makes me even more anxious about sleeping. Normally I have very vivid dreams as it is, but they’re not usually this scary. I don’t take any sleep aids because that’s what I believe triggered my sleep paralysis in the past.

Sleepparalysis,"So I was just doing some training videos for my new job, and as you can imagine they can be extremely boring so I was starting to doze off. I decided I’d take a nap as I have a few hours of free time, so set my alarm and off to sleep I went.

The dream I was having was strange, I was sat down in what seemed like a common room and some guys came round the corner. The guy at the front had a massive bulge coming out the side of his face and looked very similar to American Dad 😂. I didn’t recognize this man from real life, but I obviously knew him in the dream as I made a joke out of it and he took it lightly, it was as if we were good pals and had been for a while. He asked me to come with him to show me something but I couldn’t move. He then asked me why I wasn’t moving and I had no response so he picked me up to my feet and started walking me. I feel like I must have been walking at this point but still felt like the rest of my body was frozen stiff. At this point I wasn’t aware I was having an episode, but I feel like it must be part of it!

What happened next needs a slight back story. I’m currently on the sofa (irl) at my girlfriends staff housing (gf gone to work) in which 5 other people will be living here soon however it is only her at the moment so I’ve been making the most of our time together before her roomies arrive (which could be any time in the next couple of weeks) and I’m not technically meant to be in here as I’m not staff. Backstory over.

In my next part of the dream I now know that I’m asleep, as I feel like I’ve been woken up by her new roomies, I can hear them talking about the beds they’ve been allocated however it’s as if they don’t know I’m in the room. I didn’t see anyone just heard people talking and walking around. I need to wake up and explain why I’m here and I’m not just some weirdo asleep on their sofa 😂

I try to sit up and nothing. I try to move my legs, nothing. My eyes are open at this point and I’ve realised that there was no one in the room with me and I have dreamt it. It was at this point I knew what was happening. This is my third time so I’m a little more relaxed about it now and only stress for a couple seconds. I literally felt myself roll my eyes at myself and thought “ahh bollocks not this again!”

So now I have the real task of waking myself up. I’m looking round the room, trying to make noise, trying to move, playing the words ‘wake up’ through my head, no luck. And for some reason I thought if I stopped looking forwards, roll my eyes up to the ceiling fast then take a deep blink, I’d be awake, and it worked!!

Sleepparalysis,"So i was sleeping at my bf’s house. And woke up to the sound of someone rummaging through the bathroom attached to the bedroom. I thought it was my bf. The sounds progressively got more aggressive. And then i realized 2 things: i was paralyzed and my bf was in bed right beside deep asleep. 
It sounded like things were being thrown around. I thought maybe it was a burglar. I could hear their heavy breathing and agitated moans. I’m terrified that i can’t move or wake up my bf or do anything. 
Then, i hear it stop for a moment, before it runs out of the bathroom and into the middle of the room. I shut my eyes to scared to look at it. 
Then it starts high pitch, blood curdling screaming. 
My adrenaline is shot. I’m squeezing the pillow trying to break my body free.

Sleepparalysis,So I woke up a little earlier than normal this morning and was still tired and went back to sleep. I woke up or at least I felt like like I did I was in the same position I was when I fell asleep. So I closed my eyes and seconds later I felt something wrong. I woke up again and my room seemed darker than normal I was on my side and there's kind of like this hall in my room that goes to another room where my brother sleeps. Anyways it all felt way darker than normal and I felt really heavy I tried moving my arm up but physically couldn't. I closed my eyes again and this is where it creeps me out the most. Whe. I closed my eyes there was like this flashing light and as seconds went on it would flash in shorter intervals and the more it did that the heavier I felt. I woke up and it would stop but I still couldn't move. I fell back asleep and it happened again seconds later as if it was like the flashing was  proximity of something getting closer. I never saw anything but I felt something terrifying was near by. This happened a couple times before I woke up and felt normal and could move again.

Sleepparalysis,"So I had sleep paralysis many times in the past. But yesterday when I went to sleep I had a dream that i was in my parents bedroom, and it was so realistic. 
I did my daily tasks around the house, and i started to notice weird things. There was a big van parked in front of my house, after that some people came and ringed the door bell but i didnt see anyone. And then I was suddenly back in the bedroom levitating on top of the bed, while being choked by something(there wasnt anyone in the room I was alone) and I felt like my chest and abdomen was being ripped apart by something. It was so painful and felt so real, i felt like it was going on for an hour straight. 
Finnaly i ""woke up"" but it was sadly another dream, I was in the bedroom again, and started doing daily tasks around the house. Then i started noticing the signs from the last dream, like the van and the door bell. I got so paranoid that its going to happen again, and that something is going to try to hurt me. I ran to my room to hide, and just started getting flashing pictures of random things. I eventually got so scared and woke up forreal.

Sleepparalysis,"This morning I had another fun experience with sleep paralysis, happening at around 7am. 

It started while I was dreaming as I suddenly felt an overwhelming sense of someone just staring at me from a distance. I feel like I’m trembling in place, a loud rumble being the only thing I can hear. The best way to describe the sound is to clench your jaw really hard and plug your ears. 

Was also weird is that it comes in waves. When an episode ends it feels like whoever is watching me just goes away before returning only minutes later. I feel like I have to continue my charade of playing dead (like I can’t let it know I moved).

Sleepparalysis,"Hey y’all, just bored and wanted to share my sleep paralysis stories. For some reason I seem to only get SP when I’m crossed but anyway. 

The first time I had it I saw a girl will long brown hair and it looked wet and greasy she was looking down so I couldn’t see her face. It was my first time having sleep paralysis so I was wondering who she was or what she was doing in my room. She then walks over to my bed side where I was laying and sticks me with a needle. Fills me with some sort of fluid and walks away out of my sight. 

The second one I had was after a party I woke up and it was morning time, I couldn’t move but I could hear noises coming from below my room. I panicked and thought my parents were home and gonna see the mess from last nights party but luckily I noticed it was sleep paralysis and was all good. 

The third time I was in my room again but it was dark I felt as if someone was laying at my feet and I heard a shuffling noise at my feet. Visually I saw waves and knew I was dreaming. I tried to make a noise so my gf at the time would wake up and help me but since your body and in this case your tongue is still asleep it just came out as a slow moan. 

The fourth and most recent time I saw a zombie looking girl she walked over to my bed and said “rah rah rah” weird ik but behind her I saw a dark shadow figure hanging in the corner of the room.

Anyways, I first realized that my girlfriend’s head was leaning against my chest and  then I noticed what appeared to be a shadowy figure in the far corner of my room. The longer I looked at it the more and more I believed it was actually something else than just a shadow. When it eventually started to pace back and fourth at the foot of my bed I made an attempt to wake my girlfriend up with a shout. Nothing. Not even a whimper escaped my mouth.

Both of the shadowy figures freaked me out so bad I eventually tried as hard as I could to jerk my arm and throw a punch in the direction of both of them.

Sleepparalysis,"im gonna share a story that might be a bit blurry in my mind, but i can still never forget about it to this day.

i was a freshman in high school, and never experienced sleep paralysis until one chilling night. i was asleep but woke up at a random hour. this happens to me sometimes, but this time was different. i couldnt move my body. my tv was totally a blue screen (i dont remember why, i just remember it being a blue screen). i started to hear faint voices and i tried to call out to my mom but it was just mumbling. i was afraid. the next thing that happened really set it off for me.

my bed at that time faced my window. i had long curtains that pretty much cover my windows. however, they seemed to be pushed to the side. i could see a cloaked figure and skeletal features with a scythe walk past my window, eyeing me down with dark and empty sockets. i shit you not. i thought i was legit going to die that night. however i fortunately came out of my sleep paralysis, and i cried really hard for the next few minutes before cradling myself back to sleep.

heres the absolutely most chilling thing that came out of this, and im not making this up: someone in my neighborhood died the next day. i dont know who it was, all i know that it was someone in my neighborhood.

whether or not i hallucinated or actually saw the grim reaper is beyond me. paranormal? not quite, imo. thats why i wasnt sure what subnreddit to post this on. this one seemed most appropriate. :P",,0,chilling experience with sleep paralysis,,,False,,,,,False,,,,,public,,{},,,,,False,,,{},,3,,,self,False,,,,,True,,,,,self.Sleepparalysis,,,,False,,False,False,False,,,,,False,False,,,,,t5_2se19,,7mzhvr,,GRAVEYARDGH0ST,,0,,,False,,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/7mzhvr/chilling_experience_with_sleep_paralysis/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/7mzhvr/chilling_experience_with_sleep_paralysis/,,1514607587,0,,False,1515393420,1678548149,2017-12-30 04:19:47,,,,,,,False,1515393420.0,

Then I forgot about the phenomenon and couldn't exactly remember what had happened, and my family didn't understand what I was talking about when I tried to describe these experiences.

Anyways, I'm 19 now, and about one month ago when sleeping during the noon, I could suddenly hear my mom bursting into my room, and I imagined her (or saw?) moving around my room, I could then hear my dogs running up to me, sniffing and licking in my ear, and at one point I could even feel one of the dogs walking on my testicles, which was uncomfortable af, all while not being able to breathe or move.

Last night, I fell asleep around 8pm and woke up 1am, then I read a book till I slowly drifted in and out of sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, and tried to fall into sleep, I would suddenly become paralyzed, and be unable to breathe, this happened like 10 times or something like that, I would turn over on my side, lay paralyzed for some time, wake up drowsy and wonder to myself if it really had happened. I didn't hear anything this time, but it was still incredibly uncomfortable, and I've never had it happen before sleep, and I've never had it happen multiple times in a row.

Sleepparalysis,"Back ground about me: 23F, PTSD and related nightmares that often manifest into night terrors from childhood trauma and adult sexual assault, I also have anxiety and depressive disorders. From 16-21 I had severe epilepsy from a birth defect that was corrected with brain surgery in 2016 in my temporoparietal lobe via resection. Post op is when my insomnia and PTSD related nightmares/terrors got worse, became a nightly occurrence rather than every few months. As of October of 2017 I stopped my  prescribed sleep aid. I have been seizure free since September 2016. 

The last six months I have experienced occasional sleep paralysis but haven’t spoken to a doctor about it. Occasionally it’s been terrifying, but I’ve dealt with a lot of trauma and I can usually calm myself down. I’m cognitively aware enough of these situations that I can process the situation, and realize that it isn’t reality and hold onto that as a grounding technique. 

However tonight, I don’t know what happened. I was taking a nap in the afternoon as I had stayed up virtually all night as I normally do with my insomnia. My room was empty. I heard a loud pop and became aware of a throbbing in my head. When I finally gained enough consciousness to look around I didn’t feel anything anymore but couldn’t do more than lift my head. I called for my significant other but I couldn’t explain what had happened, the left side of my body - especially my arm wasn’t really working properly. Words weren’t connecting to my mouth but my thoughts were clear. It’s like I was still paralyzed in sleep, though very much so awake.

I wake up in the morning before my boyfriend goes to work, then when I go back to sleep I get sucked in to SP about 4 times in the span of a few hours. I have tried every sleeping position imaginable to try and prevent it and nothing seems to work. I can do the heavy breathing to knock myself out of it and it usually works if I have enough consciousness but I normally fall back asleep and the cycle starts again. I have narcolepsy and there was one time where I would have what I call a narc fit (lol) where I would be awake for about 4 seconds, enough to move a few inches, and then faint and then when I awoke, I would be in SP, do the breathing cycle, wake up, have a fit and faint, and this went on for several hours. Eventually I ended up by my bedroom door but I then had a siezure, fainted, thrown into SP, and couldnt control my breathing, only a finger and tap the door until someone finally found me. Since then, my fear of SP has grown so they always lead to terrible experiences. The most common nightmare that happens is this very tall man with a sort of potato sack covering his head drenched in blood with a scythe scraping it against the walls. Sort of like a scarecrow.

It also usually only happens when I fall asleep on my back or stomach. I also have noticed that it’s only ever when I’m waking up, like my mind has woken up before my body has. 

However, last night was completely different. It happened as I was falling asleep, like my body fell asleep before my mind did. I also had it happen while I was laying next to my boyfriend where it usually only happens when I’m sleeping by myself. I was laying on my side facing my boyfriend. Once it started I had a very high pitched ringing in my ears (happens usually, sometimes ringing, sometimes really loud music) and the ominous feeling in the room (no figures though). 

I started trying to rock my body back and forth which is what I usually do to wake myself up but it wasn’t working. I realized I had control over my breathing and could move my mouth. I tried to say “help” hoping my boyfriend would wake me up (he was thankful I didn’t say help, because it would have creeped him out haha). I of course couldn’t talk, so I just started breathing very rapidly hoping me would notice. 

He did notice, and said “hey, are you okay?” Immediately snapping me out of the episode. I woke up and said “why, was I doing something weird?” And he said “yeah, your breathing just dramatically changed.” Glad to know what I was doing in my “dream” was translating into real life.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello, over the last few months, I have been experiencing Sleep Paralysis more and more over the last few months, as the time has gone on I have had them more frequently, this last week I’ve been trying to avoid daytime naps, around 3-4 days ago I woke up &amp; later around for a little bit then decided to nap, at the time it felt slightly like a dream, I could see a bracket on a computer screen, my eyes were shut but I could still clearly see it, in the background I could hear my girlfriends YouTube video still in the background, when I tried to move my arms they just felt really heavy, and every time I tried to move a limb, my lungs felt like they were giving in each time I tried to move, so to wake and snap myself out of it, I’d have to relax myself, focus on my breathing and then move at once which would wake me up breathing heavy and sitting straight up, around 5 minutes later I tried and tried again the same nap and the same outcome, so I asled my girlfriend if next time I try it to let me know if she can feel me moving my finger, well when we tried it, I moved my finger as if I was tapping her leg, she realised it was happening again and tried to move me to wake me up, that didn’t wake me but throughout all of this I could feel her moving me, I could also sort of see her trying to move me too, and like before I had to focus on my breathing and then 10 seconds later move all at once to wake up, it worked.

Fast forward to today, still at my girlfriends house, I nap on the sofa with everyone in the room, not sure how long for; same sort of thing happens again but not as much awareness, trying to move my arms again and not much luck, this time around I wake up just quietly sort of panicking and breathing...

It’s putting me off daytime naps now more so &amp; not too sure whether it’s worth a trip to the doctors or not, I suffer with anxiety and depression but not sure if that would take any effect on it, feedback is appreciated and I’ll try to respond to messages when I can; Thanks.",,0,Consistent SP during the day,,,False,,,,,False,,,,,public,,{},,,,,False,,,{},,1,,,self,False,,,,,True,,,,,self.Sleepparalysis,,,,False,,False,False,False,,,,,False,False,,,,,t5_2se19,,7mft8r,,KayzeMKW,,0,,,False,,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/7mft8r/consistent_sp_during_the_day/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/7mft8r/consistent_sp_during_the_day/,,1514390313,0,,False,1515382904,1678547425,2017-12-27 15:58:33,,,,,,,False,1515382904.0,

But, I woke up after a small nap and then tried to go back to sleep. It didn't happen right away, but I thought I'd fall asleep eventually. 
Well, about 10 or so minutes into this, I had this incredibly weird sense, like even though my eyes were closed, I could see my room darkening. It felt as if there was some shadowy energy coming around me, and after I saw that, my chest began to feel extremely tight, and it kept getting tighter, which made me panic. My limbs felt like the heaviest things in the world, and I tried to move them, I could see myself moving them in my head, but I couldn't, they were so heavy. It took all my strength to be able to just slightly move my hands up to my eyes to rub them so I could wake up. Now, I'm too scared to try and sleep again. That was so horrifying and surreal.

Sleepparalysis,"So I woke up around 10pm after having taken a long nap starting at 6pm.

I went downstairs, I ate, drank some water and then took my birth control pill. I also realised that at some point I must had taken two because the one I was taking was the one for the next day!

Anyways, I went to sleep! And I remember dreaming but I cannot remember what it was about.

Then I suddenly woke up on my stomach and was facing the wall, looking at it. That’s the position I always sleep in. I felt my heart beating super fast like I was having a heart attack and I immediately thought I was going to die! I was terrified and because my younger sister was sleeping right next to me I started to ‘call’ her name in vain because it could barely come out. And if it did, it was definitely a faint minisucule breathy sound.

I then saw these lights that were shaped by 3 circles going vertically and each continuing down all whilst hearing a sharp ultrasound which sounded like an engine starting! I started to feel pressure all over my body, from my head to feet and thought I was about to be raped so I continuously tried to shout my sister’s name again but it wasn’t working, I tried to breath and calm myself down until it was over.

I then saw the same lights again and heard the same ultra sound when it finally stopped. So I layed there for a second because I was scared to see something in my room! When I finally sat up after a second or two, it felt like I had not been sleeping at all, I was wide awake and not at all tired. When I looked at the time it was quarter to 1am. I then woke up my sister to tell her what happened.

As of right now i’m absolutely terrified! I don’t ever want to go back to sleep. I’m traumatised.

I’ve had sleep paralysis before but never to that extent. I just wasn’t able to move or talk but this experience was on a whole other level.

Sleepparalysis,"Of course there is a reddit for this, seriously reddit is amazing sometimes. Anyways I just woke up from an SP episode and it reminded me why these things are so freaking scary. This wasn’t my first rodeo though I happen to get SP quite frequent compared to some people. (Maybe like 3-4 Times a year), but I haven’t had one in a while. I was just sleeping on my back and having a really really strange dream, it wasn’t scary it was just weird. Then a strange noise went off in my dream and I started to hear it out loud. I open my eyes and realize I’m awake from a dream but literally I cannot move ANYTHING. Being paralyzed is LITERALLY exactly what happens to you. I didn’t get any hallucinations this time (I think that happened more when I was a kid), but it was still scary AF cause I couldn’t move a muscle for what felt like a good 5 mins. It’s so annoying because I know exactly what’s going on in my head but I can’t do anything about it! I just have to wait it out until it’s over and my body lets me move again! I was just wondering do any of y’all have any tricks or tips to make it go faster or to wake up faster? Like any thoughts that make it end ? For example I also lucid dream (which btw is not the same as sleep paralysis, i think some people have the idea that it is?) ... anyways I haven’t in awhile but sometimes I’ll be right in the middle of a dream and realize it’s a dream (usually when I realize I can’t turn my light on in the dream) then when I realize I’m dreaming, it then starts to get scary and transitions into a nightmare. I just keep telling myself to wake up and if I move around a lot or my neck, it usually works and I wake up. For sleep paralysis I feel like there’s no remedy except waiting it out. I hate it.

Sleepparalysis,"Ok so I first experienced sleep paralysis when I was about 18. It was the most frightening thing ever because I felt a presence in my room and I couldn’t MOVE - thought I was being held down or had been drugged because my limbs felt so heavy, and I couldn’t speak or breathe properly. I jump to the most horrible conclusion, and that is that my abusers are back to get me. 

Since that first episode, i probably experienced sp maybe 7 or 8 times, but that all changed a few weeks ago. It’s been happening quite a lot this past month. I’m at a point where I’m too scared to go to sleep.. that probably sounds ridiculous for a 25 year old woman, but being in a paralysed state and unable to fight it is so unsettling. I always feel like something really awful is going to happen and I won’t be able to do anything about it/defend myself. Ive managed to repeat “just relax just relax it’ll all be over”  a couple times during an ep but as soon as I experience sp, I full on panic and try to scream because I’m that petrified...... and all that comes out is a weird moan/grunt. 

Even though I attempt to prepare myself for this, I’m still extremely anxious when i get into bed. I know I shouldn’t think about it because it probably makes it worse, but I can’t help it. I swear to god once it’s over, I leave my room because I felt someone in there with me, and stay awake for the the remainder of the night. 

And when I am able to open my eyes and blink, I see like... an imprint? Most recently it was a man pointing a gun but facing away from me. Gah it was f-cking horrific! Anyway this sh-t has been leaving me so tired I actually fall asleep for a few minutes when I’m at work.

Is there a way to stop this naturally so I don’t have to visit my doctor? I can tell he’s sick of hearing about my problems. 

I’ve also been told it can be stress related, and that may be the case but I don’t know what I’m stressed about! So any advice will be much appreciated.

Sleepparalysis,"i had read up on sleep paralysis before and the thought of it intrigued me, i never really wanted to experience it because it sounded terrifying but i just never could fully understand what it would be like. 
Well i know now. While i was dreaming I became aware that i was a woke myself up, i have done this numerous times before but this time when i woke up the way i thought was normal i saw a woman crouching behind the chair of my desk. It kind of looked like my mother but i couldn't tell and they were twitching like crazy. I tried to get up but couldn't but unlike other cases I've heard i could actually speak and i just yelled ""Hey!"" a few times but it still didnt get any attention. Just then out the corner of my eye i could see a little girl flailing her arms around running towards my bed, before she could reach i finally came to and woke up screaming.
Took me a bit of time to realise and come to terms of what just happened but i knew exactly what it was from my research beforehand. I went back to sleep not long after and everything was fine.
But now in a weird way i find myself wanting to have it again to really take it in while actually knowing what the experience is like but also this was one of the scariest things that had ever happened to me and if it were to happen again it could be even more frightening and now im a little worried about going to sleep",,0,"First experience, really unsettling but interesting",,,False,,,,,False,,,,,public,,{},,,,,False,,,{},,5,,,self,False,,,,,True,,,,,self.Sleepparalysis,,,,False,,False,False,False,,,,,False,False,,,,,t5_2se19,,7llqj8,,Beastcoast24,,1,,,False,,,/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/7llqj8/first_experience_really_unsettling_but_interesting/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sleepparalysis/comments/7llqj8/first_experience_really_unsettling_but_interesting/,,1513992244,0,,False,1515366291,1678546187,2017-12-23 01:24:04,,,,,,,False,1515366291.0,

I am a 22 year old female and have been experiencing sleep paralysis as long as I can remember, at least the past ten years if not more.

I've tried all the common things like not sleeping on your back and such, but I am not a back sleeper in the first place. I've also mentioned it to my doctor but they've never really had an answer for me or a solution.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve never really been able to talk to anyone about these experiences since I pay them no mind, I just wanted some answers. 

Ever since I was young, I discovered that every time I knew I was dreaming I would suddenly open my eyes and be aware of the last surroundings I’ve seen before falling asleep. To preface this, I don’t do drugs or drink unless on special occasions. So I’m sober 99% of the time. 
One instance, I was being woken up by my mom and the first time I woke up the last thing I saw was the lamp at my nightstand. When I became aware that I was dreaming I suddenly felt terrified and it felt like I opened my eyes and saw the same lamp on the nightstand, but a hand was slowly coming out from under my bed and onto my sheets. Afterwards I woke up at around 6:15 and my mom was yelling at me to take a shower, the lamp was off and the fluorescent light was on. This happened about 4 years ago. 
The next time it happened was about a year from the last one. fell asleep and a dream sequence was just about to start when I realized that I was in a dream. Suddenly everything turned to static and I could vaguely hear a voice but couldn’t remember or decipher what it was saying. I couldn’t move, and I couldn’t wake myself up. I was terrified because the static just got louder and louder until eventually I kept saying the Lord’s prayer (I was religious back then) and woke up out of breath. 
Another instance I became aware of the dream and was paralyzed I tried to take control of the dream by screaming that “This is my world.” Over and over again, but the static just got louder and eventually I caved in and was terrified so I resorted to God to save me again. I noticed however, it took me a bit longer to wake up that time. This was a year ago.
After the last instance I believe it was only a short while, maybe a week from then. I fell asleep in the afternoon but I soon realized I was dreaming and again, paralysis and static consumed me. This time I tried to be smart by staying calm and thinking about what causes this, but the fear was so overwhelming that I couldn’t help but panic and the usual screaming and praying ensued until I woke up out of breath. 
The last time I became aware that I was dreaming I was able to control reality to a certain extent. I was able to imagine up really kinky stuff but before anything fun happened I woke up. I just thought I should share this because it was the ONE instance I was able to control my dreams and be aware I was asleep without succumbing to sleep paralysis. This happened about 6 months ago. 
A while back in 2015 I had a psychology class and I asked my professor about them and she told me that I should get checked. Do I have anything to be concerned about? 
Edit: 
I’ve done some looking around and found this interesting post on /r/LUCID and it accurately depicted the feeling of falling directly into sleep paralysis (For me at least: I’ve tried it and it is spot on) The person that wrote the post described it as “yawning in your head” and immediately after trying it, I got that same mix of drowsy and scared feeling from going into sleep paralysis directly. 
I remembered a time when I was around 11 years old when I was exhausted and tried to keep myself awake, but fell asleep. I remembered being too tired to yawn, and I thought I yawned before I fell asleep but I was wrong. Shortly after I was asleep I had that same “eyes-open” feeling but instead of it being clear, I could see a black border and felt my heart racing super fast and I thought I was having a stroke. I don’t know why it’s so vivid and came back after I tried the “internal yawn” thing, but it sure worked. I would link the Reddit post but I’m only on mobile and don’t remember the name of the post.

So slight bit of backstory, I once had a  nightmare about a horror film set which had like a 100 creepy dolls, and the actor spoke about the dolls as if they were real to sell the show, specifically one.

So last night I had a normal dream, and I think I woke up under the covers. For some reason my mind thought of that doll, and as soon as I did there was a rush of wind in my left ear and it popped. My heart rate also shot up. I felt like something was to my left. I tried to scream but nothing came out. My eyes were shut and I didn't try to open them, but my feet were exposed and I remember not being able to move them.

Sleepparalysis,"The two times I've had sleep paralysis I knew what was happening so I didn't panic too much. Just lied there until I could move. Weirdly enough, both these experiences were during the morning probably around 8am-10am. I'm used to hearing everyone say this happens to them during the night.

The first time it was just that I couldn't move and there was a huge pressure on my chest making it hard for me to breath. The second time was much scarier. 

I was sleeping and remember waking up feeling something on my bed. At this point realizing I can't move so I calmly lay there waiting for it to pass. I thought it was my cat but remembered my door was closed and there's no way he or anyone else was in there cause my door is always shut and locked. It moved across the bed and around my head before it very heavily lied down on top of me. Making it harder for me to breath. I never opened my eyes during either of these experiences cause I'm very aware of what sleep paralysis is and I was terrified if I would see anything. When I could move again I looked around and nothing was there. 

Both of these experiences happened within weeks of each other. Never had sleep paralysis before these experiences or since then. Thoughts? Anyone else had similar experiences to feeling something touch you during sleep paralysis?

Sleepparalysis,"I have experienced SP several times before, but it has never been a big deal. I’ve never had visual or auditory hallucinations. It’s always just been waking up, the natural anxiety that comes with realizing I can’t move, then trying to move my fingers until I can feel my sheets, and that will normally wake me up. This afternoon, I took a nap (I usually don’t take naps) on my back (I normally sleep on my side) which I know now are all very common beneficiaries of SP. When I woke up, I couldn’t open my eyes like I normally can’t when I have SP.  I was just very aware that I was awake and could not move. After that, I had experiences I’ve never had before with SP, and I couldn’t seem to find a lot of people that have had experiences like what I think happened. I knew that I couldn’t move and couldn’t get out of bed, but then I swore that somehow I fought the crushing weight feeling just enough to barely drag myself out of my bed and onto the floor and then across my room and into my bathroom across the hall. It was almost like only my legs were paralyzed, and I had literally drug my body across the floor with just my arms. Then, I would realize that I was still in the bed and still couldn’t move.

It seemed like this went on for more than 10 minutes but I’m sure it was only a couple at most. I just haven’t seen anyone else say they had an experience where they thought they had broken the SP then realized they hadn’t. Most accounts are just of people knowing that they can’t move.

I didn’t see any ‘demons’ or have any feelings of an evil presence most people describe with SP hallucinations.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve had SP only twice in my life and the events occurred about 6 years apart. The first time I was around 28 years old. I was at a friends house sleeping on her couch. I “woke up” to something whispering a weird language into my ear and I could not move no matter how hard I tried.  I kept trying to scream for my friend but I couldn’t get any sounds out of my mouth. This is when I realized I must be dreaming. It was terrifying though and would not stop. When I actually woke up I was in the same exact position as I was in the dream which I thought was really strange and for the longest time I couldn’t tell if it was actually a dream or some demon had me paralyzed and was whispering this weird language into my ear. 
The most recent event happened about 4 months ago. It was around 6am and my husband had just gotten up to get ready for work. I was starting to drift back to sleep, but I know for sure that I heard him turn the shower on. At the exact time he turned the shower on I felt as though something came rushing through the house. It’s very hard to explain. But after the “rush” my covers were pulled tightly around my neck and something started shaking me up and down. Again, I tried to scream for my husband but could not get any sounds out, making me think it must be a dream. When the shaking finally ended and I “woke up” I was in the exact position as I was in this “dream”. I calmly walked into the bathroom and told my husband something was just on top of me shaking me. He told me I must have been dreaming. 
It felt so real. Both times. After it happened the second time I starting researching it. I didn’t see anything either time so I can’t relate to the visual hallucinations, but the whispering from the first time and the violent shaking from the second time were too real.

Sleepparalysis,"What is the worst Sleep Paralysis experience you have ever had, everyone?  Mine was pretty horrible.  I woke up on my back and I could move nothing except my eyeballs.  I rolled my eyes down and to my left where I saw a tall, lit candlestick.  That alone was scary since I could not move and do not own a candlestick of any sort.  But it got worse.  This terrafying laugh filled the room, like a tormenting cackle.  Then a girl, in her mid twenties, I'm guessing, picked the candle up, by the wax, off the candle stick and  stepped closer to me.  It did not take long for me to realize she was the sores of that horrid cackle.  As she stepped closer I could feal myself getting really hot, like she was holding the sun, not a candle.  I rolled my eyes to my upper left, where my hand was.  (Yeah, for whatever reason I was sleeping on my back with my arms up on my pillow like so dramatic movie star.  I don't normally do that, I swear.)  Anyway, I could see my hand turning black and crispy like a burning turkey in the oven.  I then watched my body burn and crumble away while this lady cackled to death.  She died of cackling... I burned to death.. It sucked.  But then I woke up, and no one was dead, so that was nice.

Sleepparalysis,"Hey guys I‘m new to this sub as I just had my first sleep paralysis and wanted to read what others have experienced. 

So yeah Ima tell you how it happened
Basically I already was in a dream and realized it was one, but  as soon as i took control I felt how I was ‚waking up‘.
Then I heard this weird like grey noise in my head and felt some weird pressure all over my body but I wasn‘t creeped out. Then as I kinda realized what was happening I saw some white dots in the middle of the room moving close to me. I was kinda weirded out, so started moving my toes, because I heard this way you could gain control over your whole body.

So now I have some questions (I could probably google, but I like to talk with people about it)
Is it normal that I kinda liked it?
I thought sleep paralysis happens when you wake up and your body isn‘t able to move, is there any reason it happened while/after my dream?

Sleepparalysis,"Aside from the usual demon or children laughing, I've had two experiences i couldnt explain. Once while abroad, i had 3 aliens standing beside my bed tugging my blanket that was up to my neck choking me. I couldn't move anything below the blanket. They just took turns staring closely at me. After i woke up, i noticed 3 dime size red spots on my face. Perfect circles aligned into a perfect triangle. They went away after a few days.

Second incident. I was staying overnight at my BF place and i slept on my back facing him to the side. When the episode happened his face wasnt him. It wasnt even human. He looked like   that yellow dude from sin city mixed with golem.  Im apparently screaming ""youre not real"" to him until suddenly a bright light from the window blinds me and when i look he's himself again. My bf later asked that morning why i was shoving his face away screaming ""youre not real"". Which makes me wonder when i try to get out of an episode i usually scream but theyre wimpy ones, would he be able tp hear me if he was listening? Anyhow, the next morning i go to work and remember seeing an article in the paper that there were reports of a bright light in my area.

Sleepparalysis,"I know many will say that sleep paralysis is a state of brain activity and not supernatural, but I am not so sure.  I would like to know others thoughts on the origination of the phenomenon. 

I have had sleep paralysis three times in my life, but the first time was by far the strongest and perhaps the most significant experience I have ever had. I was 17 at the time (I’m 38 now). Pretty much had a classic experience. Crushing weight on chest, awake but could not move. I had no visual or auditory happenings, but had something far more intense happen. 

At the foot of my bed, on the left side, I felt an overwhelming presence. It was a malevolent presence, sinister, evil. I have never felt anything like it before or since. It is impossible really for me to describe the feeling, but when I say “evil” I mean it.  This lasted for what I estimate was 90 seconds or so. 

I’m a fairly rational and skeptical person, but I don’t think I will ever be convinced that this experience is not “supernatural” in some way. Why did I have a specific sense of malevolent presence in such a specific spot in my room?  And why did this feeling of “evil” suddenly leave the room instantaneously once I regained control of my limbs?

Sleepparalysis,"Weird title, let me explain.

I've had sleep paralysis for a couple years now. It doesn't happen too often, but when it does it's consecutive. It's also not that intense. I usually can close my eyes and come out of it.

Can sleep paralysis get progressively worse?

This morning I had sleep paralysis. Same thing, open my eyes, it's daylight and everything looks the exact same. Then I close my eyes. This is where it gets a little abnormal for me.

I close my eyes and it usually takes less than thirty seconds for me to break out of it. It wasn't working. I try to make a fist, but I just felt my hand contracting, painfully. I keep my eyes closed, and maybe a minute more passes. I start hearing this rushing noise. It sounded like rushing wind or water. Then I can feel my eyes moving rapidly and I wake up.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve been back home from college for a day and a half. I just finished my first semester as a freshman, aka, finals week for the first time ever. I’ve been cramming with very little sleep, and haven’t slept well since I’ve been back. 

It’s currently 2:49 am. 
I laid my phone down to try to sleep around 2:10. I started having vivid dreams that I was shopping at the mall, and all of sudden everything went dark in whatever store I was in, and then the dream itself went dark. I thought I had woke up, so I tried to reach for my phone.... but I couldn’t move. Then I heard a child like voice call my name, and a shadow moving across my room, IN THE DARK. I knew exactly what was about to happen, so I started screaming, trying to wake myself up. As usual, however, each time I opened my mouth to scream or say anything, I got lockjaw. I woke up when my father basically busted my door down trying to open my door... because he said he heard me screaming “LEAVE ME ALONE” 


I’ve experienced this once before, in my dorm. It happened around the same time. of night/morning. The situation was different, as I was recovering from a weekend of no sleep, barely any food, and heavy drinking.) My roommate and her boyfriend were less than five feet away, and said she woke up because she heard me talking in my sleep. I didn’t know what was happening so I got the full experience of SP. 

I heard our dorm door being unlocked, which was weird because the only two people with keys were in the room. I heard familiar laughing, coming from the door as I asked who was there. It sounded like a close friend of mine, who had stayed with me that weekend but left that morning. The laughing carried all the way from the door to my bedside, and then it turned deep.

Sleepparalysis,"I’ve made a reddit post about 7 months ago about sleep paralysis but on a different forum. But to present date it’s become much more frequent and I don’t know if it’s evil or not. By frequent I mean once a week. It started last week depending on when your reading this the beginning of December 2017. It was a typical day and as it became night I went to bed and slept. At some point during the night I “woke up” and by woke up I mean it was like I was awake but I wasn’t. I was still dreaming. When I “opened my eyes” I was looking directly at my pillow then everything around me started shaking like a high magnitude earthquake. After the shaking stopped I tried to move but I couldn’t not matter what I tried i could not move. Then i “woke up” for the second time. I still couldn’t move but I felt that something was there. As I “opened my eyes” for the second time I tried to call for help but I could only muster a little yelp. I “closed” my eyes and then “opened” them once more and it was a third person point of view. I was in a dark room and I was very close to my body. Note my room is purple. This room was pitch black. I  could still feel everything that was going on I was still in control. It was like I was in a pit so I began to climb out, as soon as I started something began to hold me down. I immediately lost all my breath and no matter how hard I tried I could not do it. Then I “woke up” for the third time. This time I could move but barely. (Note I am not scared at all) I turn my head to see a figure with a white face with pitch black eyes and mouth and it comes up to me. Then I “wake up” again for the fourth time. I know that figure is still there and for less than 2 seconds I can move. Get up swing open the door and run into my parents room and jump on their  bed. Then I actually wake up. I’m facing the wall and my hearts racing. Not from fear but from shock. The whole experience happened 3 times that night. 

That leads us to tonight. It happens once again but differently. I cannot move once again, but I’m in the dark room. But I’m much farther away from my body in the third person view. I see myself trying to climb out and I’m being help down but I don’t lose all my breath I’m still fighting it until I eventually succumb and need to breath.  I don’t know why but I know that I need to get back to that room I NEED to get back to that room. When I open my eyes my heart starts racing because I know that thing is there. I’m not afraid but my heart is still racing for some reason. I began to move forward but when my chest moved it felt like two fingers were pressing down on my chest.  Then the shaking began, but it was on the left side not the right. And throughout the night I can hear tapping on my window. I know that I cannot turn around until sunrise.  The shaking happened 12 time tonight and it’s a little concerning. But what I’ve come to terms with is that whatever this thing is, it doesn’t want me to climb out of that pit. It fears what I’m going to do once I’m out and knowing that is the reason I’m not scared. It knows that I don’t fear it, and it knows that I know that it fears me. I don’t know how to fight this thing, i want to take back my sleep. If anyone can tell me what’s going on that would be great.

Sleepparalysis,"So... this is going to sound far-fetched, but I promise this is all true. Sleep paralysis is something I’ve always been afraid of but never suffered from. The idea of it just terrifies me, and now, as someone who has (at least I think so) had an episode, I can definitely attest to how terrifying it really is. Since I don’t want to type it out over and over I’ll be referring to sleep paralysis as SP for the remainder of the post. 

Starting from the top, I recently moved back home from college and I live with my grandparents now. Place used to creep me out, not so much now that I’m older, now I have a reason to be afraid again. Ha. 

Anyway, yesterday I felt sick. Out of nowhere got a bad migraine and my stomach starts flipping out. I take some headache medicine and pills to ease my stomach and I grab a damp cloth to rest over my eyes for my headache before laying down around 4 PM, hours before my usual bedtime which would be 10-11 PM. 

I wake up at 5:42, 7:30, 10, and then 12. I remember waking up each time, and at around 6 and 7:30 I went to the living room and talked to my grandparents before going back to rest. The last time I woke up, I couldn’t fall back asleep because of stomach issues. I drank some water, took a pill, and browsed reddit/other social media for a bit before going back to bed. 

Now, from my like hour of SP research following this incident I realize there are a lot of red flags here. Napping, sleep schedule was off, I woke up then spent a prolonged period of time awake before returning to sleep, I get it. But here is where it gets weird and why I’m afraid people might not believe my story. While scrolling through reddit I came across a picture in r/creepy called Sleep Paralysis or something similar. I believe it is currently the top post in this sub as well. 

See where I’m going with this? Yeah. I know. 

I decide to go back to bed around probably 12:30, and wake up again a few hours later. I remove the cloth from my eyes, which I had been putting back over my eyes/forehead every time I went back to bed, and check with my watch which I fell asleep with on, the time? 2:32 AM. I return the cloth to my face, and close my eyes. I can’t remember exactly if I fell asleep from here or was awake this entire time, maybe I was stuck in a “limbo” which I guess is what SP is if I understand currently. 

The cloth is on my face and I’m laying on my back, eyes closed. I started hearing a voice in my head. I’m going to refer to this voice as the demon, I never saw him. Whispering. I can’t quote exactly what was said, be it was scary as hell. Reassuring me how hopeless I am, telling me I belonged to him and I was screwed. At this point, I try to take this cloth off my face, but I can’t move. Panic sets in, naturally.  I’m thinking “What the hell is going on?”

I’m a Christian man, but admittedly struggling with my faith currently. Not sure what’s right, what’s wrong, what I believe, but in that moment I knew one thing. I felt like I was about to die, and if there is a God, he would be the only one in that room with me who could help. I start praying profusely but can’t open my mouth to speak any words out loud. In my mind I’m telling the demon that I belong to God, to leave me alone, saying “Jesus” over and over, commanding him to leave. How you would expect a religious person to react in such a situation. 

He reassures me that there is no hope. I’m told that I am surrounded but I can’t see anything because I have this damn cloth over my eyes. I can feel a presence in the room. There were multiple beings in the small space left in my room around my bed. At this point I am freaking out, I can’t move, I’m told I’m surrounded and assured that there is no hope. 

I need to get out of this bed, out of this room. It’s not safe here. I tell this thing to get off of me. He laughs. My mouth opens at this point, but I can’t speak. I can’t breathe. It opens wide as if I’m about to vomit. I HATE vomiting. At this point I still can’t see, but have almost a vision of my open mouth spewing this black air and insects. I felt like I was throwing up.

I don’t know what happened, but I broke free. I finally had control. I tore the cloth from my face and I was alone in a dark room. Which in itself is not normal because I normally sleep with the TV on. Quickly, I scramble out of my bed and to the living room. There’s nobody out here, obviously, it’s like 2:30 in the morning. I walk back to my room and turn on TV but I couldn’t be in there where it happened. 

I thought reading a bible might help, but I decided not to. Maybe holding on to the idea of this being SP is better than the idea of it being something demonic and reading a bible would make it more real. 

I wanted to go for a drive but I was so afraid of being alone. In that moment I felt so alone. 

I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression, I know what the loneliness feels like but this was next level. Never experienced fear like this. 

I’m sitting in the living room watching TV now, still shaking in fear, it feels like I threw up, and my stomach is even worse from the anxiety that came with this. Morning is still far. It’s 3:48. 

TL;DR: Saw some creepy picture of sleep paralysis, woke up in the middle of the night sick and had a similar experience. Most terrifying thing I’ve ever been through. I can’t go back to bed.

Sleepparalysis,"While my experiences have stopped ever since sleeping with a light on (probably because I am not getting REM sleep), but most of them were harmless stuff like feeling I was floating in the air or feeling a sense of doom. There were times that I did experience more frightening things, such as shadow figures:

The first time I ever experienced a visual hallucination, I was about seven and had just woken from a dream with a fever. I could only move my eyes around and heard a few creaks coming up the steps next to my bedroom. A dark figure passed by the room and seemingly went to my brother's room. It came back at times and would just look in before disappearing back into the hallway. The creepy thing about it was that it looked like it had bright green eyes that had no pupils and would not move. As a kid, I just tried closing my eyes and hoping it to go away. One of the times I opened my eyes back up, it was standing past my doorway and into my room, scaring me into closing my eyes once more. When I opened them, it was gone, but I still could hear creaking as if it was crawling on the floor to me. I could not see it from the way I was positioned, which was probably the most frightening thing I have experienced. I closed my eyes once again and held it that way for a few seconds before I opened my eyes back up. There it was, standing right next to me. As it was more black than the room, I could see it reach out and wrap its hands around my throat. It only squeezed lightly, but, as a seven year old, I stopped breathing. Eyes locked onto its the whole time, it finally just let go and left, disappearing down the steps with no noise. I do not know how I got back to sleep after that, but I did.

The second, and last, time I experienced sleep paralysis is definitely less scary than my first. I was about fifteen, and I was sleeping in the same room as when I was seven. I remember just kind of waking up and rolling around, which is very odd for sleep paralysis. When I opened my eyes, there was a black shadow figure dressed in a man's noir-outfit, standing right next to me as I had slept on one side of my queen-sized bed. It did not do anything to me like the first figure had, but I remember trying to desperately scream out for my mother and finding that it was impossible to. I could not open my mouth, nor produce any sound. Oddly, when I closed my eyes and opened them, I found myself in a new position than I was in before, now laying on my left side than my right. Did not sleep for the rest of the night after that, and had a hard time falling back to sleep the next night.

In one dream we were flying and donkey was an airplane. He flew us into a dark tunnel. 

In another donkey was a man who took me to what I assume was hell, and we were standing on an island in the middle of a fiery lake. Donkey always told me horrible horrible things, and this time he was saying how ugly I was and how he was going to fix me, he was going to change my body to make me beautiful. 

I begged him not to, I told him I liked the way I looked, but he reached for my face and I ""woke up.""

When I would wake from a donkey dream, I would still be tingling all over and couldn't move, but I was mentally back in my room. That's when I'd see all sorts of shit. 

Once it was a dark looming figure that I thought was my dad, another time it was a midget thing that was running around my bed. 

These dreams and hallucinations were always pretty terrifying, for a little kid. I remember the tingling being excruciatingly painful. Eventually I figured out that if I slept on my stomach I wouldn't have the dreams, and I've been a donkey-free stomach sleeper ever since. 

Until last night. I'm 23 now, haven't had an episode of sleep paralysis since I was about 6, but for some weird reason I was falling asleep on my back when I felt the tingling. 

A part of me wanted to just let it happen so I could experience it again, and another part of me was terrified. Each time I'd nod off, I'd feel the tingling and make myself snap out of it. 

I could move, so I finally rolled myself onto my stomach to try and get some sleep. That's when it happened. For some reason, the creepy nun/monk thing from the second conjuring movie popped in my head and that thought alone sent me into a full thing of tingles. 

I was thinking ""please, just don't let me see donkey."" After all these years, I was still terrified of him like a little girl. 

I could feel the creepy nun thing in the room with me, and I heard chanting in my ear, like monks chanting. Thankfully it was a short episode and nothing happened with donkey. But I was terrified for hours after that something was in the room with me. 

So, does this mean that my sleep paralysis is back after all those years? Is this going to be a recurring thing? I really hope not, because it was even more terrifying than I remember.

Sleepparalysis,"I've had SP episodes off and on since I was younger.

I had four nightmares mixed with SP last night.

I got chased by Pennywise, had a chunk bitten out of my back, had to fight several people trying to break into my house during some ""game' some eyeball entity on a television was explaining to me, and got cut with a razor.

I literally felt the most painful bits of these dreams. I felt that man bite a chunk out of my back and I felt my skin slice open from that razor.

Normally I smoke so much weed I never dream, let alone get SP, but last night I went to bed sober and kept waking up from each dream only to go into another one.

One time, I was even visited by... well... what appeared to be Lilith. Some busty naked demoness that was chewing the lips off of some guy in a bathtub. I woke up from that one with her hands around my throat choking me.

Last night, in one of my dreams a stranger came to the door and my girlfriend was talking to her.

I felt IMMENSE TERROR when this person came to the door and I was trying to scream but felt frozen, like I was powerless to do so, even in the dreamscape.


My question is, is there any evidence this is something more than just hallucinatory? I've done hallucinogenic drugs in the past, no time recent, and this feels distinctly different.

Like, when I have a bad dream it feels like it's just an experience with some less savory elements. I commonly dream of zombies for example, but those don't induce terror in me. These sorts of experience seem like something is out to get me from the very start of the experience. Rather than having bad elements, it felt like the entire thing was something negative that had a goal to melt my fucking mind.

I'm not even sure I've ever experienced terror in my waking life like I did last night when that person came to the door. I was shaken to the core of my very being, and I've seen some shit.


This feels sinister. Demonic. It feels evil.  Why would my mind create such terrifying experiences to torture itself? Where is the logic in that? I have had dreams when I don't smoke that are not like these ones. These feel different on some inherent base level.

I don't understand that concept, and there's a distinct recurrence of this experience personifying itself as something in the dream that induces pure terror in me. It either does that or transforms an object in my environment into something terrifying when I'm in that weird ""half awake hallucinating but can't move"" state.


I can accept that these experiences are fiction, but they feel very real. Disturbingly, these dreams seem far more lucid than the other ones. I don't understand what is happening.

Sleepparalysis,"A little background. I know all about SP and have experienced it about 15 times in the span of a year when I was 18 and several more times throughout the following decade.

Even though (apart from my late teens) SP has been extremely rare in my life, I have regularly had a similar experience that I'm curious about, since I've been having it MUCH more recently, and it's a bit of a mystery to me.

I've only ever had true SP when waking up in the morning, and unlike most people, *always* while sleeping on my chest (like I sleep most of the time), never on my back (I get limited OBEs on my back rarely in the morning). The experience I'm referring to happens when *falling asleep* and goes and feels like this:

I'm falling asleep and well into the blurred and weird state between sleep and wakefulness. Thoughts become weird and absurd. All normal. Then suddenly, there is a feeling of slight dread, that inflates and escalates *very* quickly. Let's say this is point A. Not always, but very often, this change is brought about by the weird half-asleep thought flow turning ""dark"" in a way - weird versions of things that trouble me, from the usual things that would trouble anyone (gory scenes, monsters and such) to weird versions of more specific personal issues. This very quickly snowballs from mental discomfort to near-panic. 

On top of this, I start feeling like I'm ""sinking"" or slipping away towards some threshold, like I'm in a metaphorical funnel, and if I slide inside too deep, beyond a certain line, something really bad will happen. I can feel this line exists, even though I've never crossed it. It feels like slipping into a black hole, or quicksand.

It becomes extremely difficult to move when my thoughts turn sour and I enter this state, but it is possible, although it feels very uncomfortable. The moment I manage to move and arm or a leg, which takes considerable effort, I'm awake (and a bit distressed). If I resume sleep in the same position, for example, having only moved my leg to break this trance, there is a high chance of this repeating. That's why I move my whole body, shake my head a little to wake up completely (it feels like I'm resetting my thoughts away from those that caused this), turn around and go to sleep in a different position, and it almost never happens again that night. The moment I move is point B. Between point A and B perhaps 3-4 perceived seconds elapse.

Now, I've never ""slipped"" beyond the line (I thought about trying to see what happens, but the fear is too much and I get scared about ""not being able to get back"" and losing my mind if I slip too far), but what's on the other side seems very familiar: I'm almost certain it's SP. 

I just want to know if other sufferers of SP find this familiar, do you have SP onsets like this? All of my morning experiences have not started like this - they have started without warning. Possibly because while I'm still falling asleep, a part of wakeful lucidity remains and is able to recognize the onset and act - something that may be absent in the morning when lucidity has yet to awaken after the night?

There's never the unbearable noise nor any feeling of a presence like can happen with normal SP, but the sinking feeling is very similar.

I've had these ""failed onsets"" ever since I've had my first SP experiences 12 years ago, and lived with them just fine. They were the occasional thing, not too rare, but nowhere near regular. The reason I'm asking more about them now is because I've been having them almost every night for the past few weeks, unsurprisingly coinciding with a difficult time in my life and the worst sleep hygiene I've had in many years.

These experiences feel like a back door into the same place I already know, but I've never entered fully to make the connection. I kind of want to know for sure that this is really SP and not some night terror crap or some other such parasomnia like that, because I really don't need even SP, let alone that.

Sleepparalysis,"Since I was around 11~12, I've gotten SP at least once a week. Some of the episodes have been worse than others, but about 50 minutes ago I had the **hands down** worst I've ever had in my life.

I had never seen anything or heard anything before during one of my episodes, and still haven't seen anything. However, I heard things for the first time, and it was terrifying. 

For the past few days, because of the dry winter air, I've been getting nosebleeds. Sure, they're no big deal and they happen when the weather gets like this. I had 2 nosebleeds in the same hour, each in a different nostril, before going to bed. I was asleep for maybe ~1.5 hours, and I woke up into SP. My initial thought was ""Okay, here we go, just wiggle your fingers and your toes and you'll get yourself out of it in a few seconds."" Normally this works for me, but this time it wasn't.

I started to get a bit more anxious because of how long it was lasting. Typically for me it lasts anywhere between 10-20 seconds, and at this point it had to have been a solid minute. ""Okay, this is new... I don't know what to do."" It was starting to get a bit difficult to breath, And my adrenaline was starting to pump. Then I felt a warm stream starting to come down nose/mouth/cheek area.

This is when I started to panic.

I was not dripping blood, it was a stream of blood trickling out of my nose, and there was nothing I could do about it. I'm frantically trying to move my whole body, and of course it's not working. There's starting to be a loud ringing sound in my ears, and that's when I heard different sounds. People sounds. I live in a dorm room with one roommate, and my back was turned to him while this was happening. I DISTINCTLY heard him up and walking around, talking about something that had to do with beer. I also heard the voice if his girlfriend talking to him, like they were having a conversation. 

Then came a third voice, and I didn't recognize it at all. It was deep and raspy sounding, and it sounded like it was right next to my head. I couldn't make out anything that it was saying, I only know that it was one of the most frightening voices I've ever heard. About ~2.5 minutes(I think) had gone by at this point, and I was honestly in the mindset that I was going to die, right then and there. All these voices were SO convincingly real, I was absolutely sure that there were 3 people in the room behind me, all talking. My nose was still gushing blood, my ears were ringing louder than ever, and heart felt like it was going to explode. 

After ~3 minutes, I SOMEHOW managed to flail my arm up and over my head, and it instantly made my body reconnect with my brain and I snapped out of it. I shot right up and let out a combination of a scream and a gasp for air, and looked behind me. My roommate was asleep, but I woke him up. At this point I was in a bit of shock(I still kind of am). My nose was bleeding, I was gasping for air, I was trying to look around and see who was talking, but there was nobody there besides my roommate, who was asleep the whole time. It fucked me up because the voices sounded SO real, it really made me think that there were other people in the room.

After my roommate woke up, he asked me what the fuck was going on, and turned on a light. 

There I was, sitting up in bed, covered in blood, staring at him and gasping for air. He already knew I got nosebleeds, and I told him about having SP occasionally, but he never would've expected to see me like this. He was scared as hell. I was trying to explain to him what happened because he wanted to call an ambulance. I was simultaneously trying to convince him, and myself, that everything was okay.  

I was able to get some tissues and eventually stopped the bleeding. I changed my bloody sheets and pillow cases, and my roommate is now wide awake. That brings us to now. I'm not sleeping for the rest if the night, and I don't think my roommate is either. I'm honestly traumatized from it. I don't usually think like this, but I would rather be dead than have that happen to me again. 

To make things even worse, I have a final for my analytical chemistry class in 3 hours. I don't know how the fuck I'm gonna be able to concentrate during that.

Sleepparalysis,"I had sleep paralysis three times in my entire life before coming to college - and since coming here I've had SP at least 10-15 times. One week it happened about 4 times. I know it's probably due to the stress and screwed up sleep schedule.


Anyway, I've had sleep paralysis the night before each of my finals so far and during every nap I've taken.


The weirdest stories happened Friday night and last night (Sunday night). Both of them involved false awakenings.


Friday night I remember waking up and realizing I couldn't move so I freaked out and managed to sit up, walk over to my roommate, and try to wake them up to help me. Then I realized I could see myself lying in bed so I figured I must be dreaming. Then I woke up for real but I couldn't move again and was experiencing the typical SP vibrations I usually feel - my back was towards the wall and it felt like something was getting closer and going to drag me down into the crack between my wall and my bed. Getting out of SP felt really weird this time - it felt like I had to rip myself out of my body to wake up. I don't know how to explain but it was a weird sensation...


Then last night I remember waking up to my roommate making noises like she was possessed. It freaked me out so I sat up, grabbed my phone, and started trying to turn the flashlight on. I couldn't get it on and it felt like something was lurking nearby and I was terrified. This went on for about 5 minutes before I realized - despite the fact that everything seemed very real - that I was dreaming. So then I managed to actually wake up but I was stuck in SP and the noises were still ongoing. When I finally got out of SP the noises were gone. Needless to say, my roommate was not the one making strange noises last night.


Both of these nights I had been up til about 2 AM cramming for exams and had taken weirdly timed naps during the day.

So a couple of articles point out it might be a sign of altzgeimer, tumour, **epilepsy**. So I thought I'd ask this sub if there's a connection between SP and phantom smelling. I mean I was pretty cool about it, nothing nasty was ""smelt"", but the articles got me worried. I mean, it's not like doctors will help - in my country they discard even SP compliants =\

Sleepparalysis,"I've been dealing with sleep paralysis for quite some time now. It happens way too often for my liking, like two or three times a week.

I was falling asleep and I could hear the ringing in my ears that usually tell me an SP episode is about to happen, but I couldn't move or wake up. I felt something at the foot of my bed. It's usually a little boy that ends up right in front of my face screaming words I can't understand until I can finally get myself awake. or it's something I can honestly only describe as a six foot tall demon looking thing that gets on top of me and starts choking me and laughing that I can't scream or do anything.

I actually did a small experiment today. I was moving my hand and then stopped moving it, counting to 5 seconds.

Sleepparalysis,"Before I start, I just want to warn that I've never made a post on Reddit or anything meant to be read by others so if this all seems choppy, and out of order, than that's why.

I usually have a pretty strict sleeping schedule. One that once I fall asleep, I don't really wake up up from until my alarm goes off. Yesterday though, I was stressed out and tired so when I got home, I took a nap. I haven't taken a nap since I was 9, because I know that when I wake up it won't be morning, but at some outrageous time of night. 

I woke up from my nap at 3 in the morning as I projected. Just so you don't get confused, this wasn't the start of my sleep paralysis. I woke up, was angry at myself once I checked the time, and began watching tv. When I realized nothing interesting would come on during that time, I decided to turn it off and to go back to sleep. Needless to say, my sleep was not peaceful. My family nicknamed me 'Chicken Little' because of how paranoid I was. I'm 16 years old and I still have a nightlight and have to cover my face with a blanket, only leaving a small hole to breathe. I got comfortable on my side and fell asleep. 

I've never had sleep paralysis before last night so I wasn't sure what was happening. I felt myself flip on my side onto my back. This was really uncomfortable for my so I tried to flip back to my side again. That's when I realized I couldn't move. Imagine my confusion. I wasn't putting the pieces together. My mind was blank when i felt slight pressure on my chest, and then a sharp pain in my stomach. I watch a lot of paranormal movies, story times, and I read a lot of subs like these so I figure out what was happening to me. I didn't believe that sleep paralysis was cause by the reasons scientists gave, I always thought they'd have to be caused by something paranormal.I kept my eyes closed because I was afraid of what I would see if I opened them. 

The pain and pressure grew and grew until it was unbearable. I tried to squirm but I still couldn't move my body. I remembered one of my favorite YouTubers talked about her sleep paralysis experience said that if you wiggled your toes, you could slowly wake up. I began wiggling my toes and my fingers. I could move my whole foot, and then my arms, and then my legs but I still could feel the pain and I couldn't lift my whole body. 

I spoke softly ""Get off"" . I still couldn't move. 

""Get off"" I could say it more loudly this time. I could hear noise, but I couldn't think of exactly what it was, but I knew it was directly in front of me

Then I said ""Go back to hell!"" I found the strength to yell this time. ""Go back go back go back""

I felt a jolt on my bed and then I sat upright and there wasn't nothing out of the ordinary in my room, but I know what happened was real because when I woke up I could still feel the pain in my stomach.

I know this story seems impossible, fake, exaggerated, but I have no reason to make this up. This was horrific for me and I can't imagine sleeping comfortably again.

Sleepparalysis,"Hi everyone,

So I've been having sleep paralysis for the last 10 years, on and off. 

I've seen all kind of hallucinations, friends, the old lady, demons. But mostly it is just audio. I mix real life audio (people talking, snorring etc.) with my imagination. So when I'm sleeping at the couch at my parents place (happens sometimes). I can hear voices of people who aren't there, talking with people who are there..

I also hear a low growling, pounding from inside my head and scratching noises on the walls. 
Sometimes the hallucinations manifest themselves into a physical touch, where it can almost feel like I'm being liftet from my bed.

A couple of years I started to get sleep paralysis within dreams, so I feel like I'm having sleep paralysis, but instead of waking up IRL, I wake up into a dream and then this continue for cycle of 1-3 times.
 
However the above is all what I'm used to. Tonight I woke up from sleep paralysis into what i thought was reality.
My appartment was all rearranged and things where all trashed. To me this seemed real, but I kept asking myself ""Is this real? Is this real?"" and then I started to cry, like hulking within the dream. 
And then it happened, the thing I've never experienced before, I accepted the dream as reality, I was 100% convinced it was reality (this never happens to me). Since I woke up, I've been totally beside myself.

Does any of you experience sleep paralysis in a similar way? I guess a smart way of describing it could be Inception like sleep paralysis (dreams within dreams etc.)

Sleepparalysis,"I've suffered from sleep paralysis for a good long time now, it's usually the same narrative wherein I'm asleep in my room, I hear the front door open and I can hear someone coming upstairs. I know it's a man, I know he's going to hurt me and I know I need to save my kids. I always get the feeling that if I can just move my arm I'll be fine and able to move and stop him. I can't ever move my arm though and after what seems like forever I wake up. It never seems to get any less scary. 

Recently though I've been experiencing another dream scenario and I've been trying to figure out if it's just another form of sleep paralysis but from what I've read I can't seem to find anything similar to what I'm experiencing and I think it's sleep paralysis but just for peace of mind I'd like to confirm that. Anyway, the new episodes usually start out wherever/whenever I fall asleep (I'm prone to accidental daytime naps due to lack of sleep from dreams/sleep paralysis combined with kids). I usually have this horrible sense of impending doom and I try to wake up but I can't. I feel like if I don't wake up then I'm going to die but I can never wake. It's hard to describe but I think it feels like I'm drowning or slipping away and I'm screaming so much it hurts my head - although I'm apparently completely still and silent during this - I seem to wake up then fall back asleep and have this whole thing again, usually about 3/4 times before I properly wake up. Although I'm never sure if I'm actually waking up and going back to sleep or just dreaming that I'm waking up/going back to sleep.

Anyway, I just wondered if anyone else suffered from a similar type of sleep paralysis or if this is a different thing entirely? Always nice to know I'm not alone/completely losing it!

Sleepparalysis,"i am not sure if this is just my imagination or if my grandma really can visit me (or if it’s something else) but ever since she passed a year ago i have been having weird “dreams”, but they don’t feel like dreams because every time i️ see her I️ know that she’s dead... so i️ immediately start crying and hugging her and asking her how she is. 

The only time ive ever had a dream of her where I️ i forgot she had passed was two months after she passed, and for the first little bit i was just enjoying her company, we were just watching tv and having tea. Then she turns and looks at me, and she reminds me that she is dead. “I’m not really here, i’m dead” word for word.... 

Lastly..and here is where it gets really weird. Now i’m not sure if something evil was trying to use the guise of my grandma to get into my life.. but here we go. about 4 months after her passing, i dreamt that i was sitting in a room, full of christmas decorations. There was a chair in front of me, and there was something sitting on the chair rocking it back and forth, wearing a santa suit. I️t definitely wasn’t human, but I️ couldn’t make out what it was. Anyways, i ended up transitioning from that dream into sleep paralysis. i opened my eyes but immediately knew i️ couldn’t move, To my right of my bed, i heard the voice of my grandma, so soothing, i missed her. i don’t remember what she was saying though. All i️ knew is that i felt very at ease and relaxed. Next, i started to hear faint heavenly music, like trumpets.. and i saw a white light, i️ felt like i was gonna die but i wasn’t scared. 

Suddenly, the music and the distant white light disappeared. And at the end of my bed i️ felt the most DEMONIC spirit hovering over me. It wasn’t pressing on my chest, But it was there. It started talking to me in a stern voice but i️ was screaming in my head because i was terrified of hearing what it had to say to me. Anyways, I️ started screaming so loud, it was a bloodcurdling scream that woke up my whole family and they ran to my room. 

Now i know that many say sleep paralysis is in your head but this experience scared the crap out of me and i️ feel like it is spiritual? Has anyone had any crazy SP experiences with demons?

Sleepparalysis,"So, I had stopped talking to one of my friends that I had been friends with for years. I know it's probably just petty of me but it really made me mad. We were 19 at the time and I had been having horrible sleep paralysis for years. It was awful and terrifying each time I had it. I would wake up hearing, what I can only explain as, loud whispers that made no sense. Then I would open my eyes there would be a little girl in my room and she would start to scream. After reading online that if you try to wiggle your toes or fingers than you can break free I always try to remember that and try to remember it's not real. It almost felt like I had white noise all over my body, which sounds strange because you can't feel sound. This was the usual thing that happened most of the time. I had others and in my worst one I had woke up feeling that heavy pain on my chest and a man was on me asking me my breast size. When he started to unbutton my shirt I started to break free feeling frantic. It's not an experience id wish on anyone.

It got worse when I was 18 and happened almost every night and it got to the point I was so terrified to sleep. Of course I told my friend. So, we proceeded to get into a huge argument when I found out she was purposely trying to go through it. Not because she wanted to know what I experienced but because she thought it sounded like a cool high.

I guess why I'm posting this is to ask people who do think this is a fun free high is to urge you to research it before you just go out and try to do it.

Sleepparalysis,"Here is my weird sleep story: 

So I have always been a vivid dreamer, and I’ve had episodes of sleep paralysis (probably 12-16 times total) starting my freshman year of college and for the last 10 years. I’ve never seen the dark figure some report to see, or felt the weight on my chest. For me I am just fully mentally awake, but can only look in the direction my eyes are already looking with no control over ANY movement or breathing. I’m just seeing the wall/ pillow/ floor/ where ever my body was already facing. It’s just scary because you feel like there could be something right out of your sight line, or you could be dying or something. I have always just tried to focus on vocalizing and moving my toes and then after what seems like forever I can slowly move and “snap out of it” When someone is with me like a roommate or my fiancé and they hear me start to vocalize (sounds like a scream whisper so creepy but it’s all I can do at first) they can shake me and I can regain movement. I’ve done research on it and it’s all pretty typical, and now I’m not scared if it happens, I just try to move and wait to “wake up.” I have hallucinated during it one time (the most recent time) where I it felt like a dog or wolf was mouthing at my hand, which of course I couldn’t move my hand away or see anything it was just a feeling. It felt like it was really licking my hand/ mouthing it. Like the hot breath and wet. (no pets in the house). Maybe that was a step towards astral projection? I’m very cognizant of what is happening so I feel like I could, if that’s a real thing. I dk.

Second, I also lucid dream, and dream vividly. My dreams are chaotic and long and extremely detailed. Not every time, but most times I am aware it’s a dream and can move at my own will, pick things up, look at them ect. I can’t change the surroundings at will but I can choose how I move through them. For example in a stressful dream about work or something I can just leave and walk to another less stressful department. I know my boss isn’t going to fire me and that it’s my damn dream and I can leave if I want. Stuff like that. 

Third, I do the thing where you have false awakenings. I’ll wake up to my alarm, hit snooze, get dressed and brush my teeth.... only to wake up for real still in bed. It was a dream of waking up. Some mornings I could do it several times, it’s so frustrating. Since I started working for myself from home it hasn’t happened. But I’ve done it probably 20 mornings at least in the last three years. 

All of this is to say, are there ways to use my weird sleep stuff in an insightful way?

Sleepparalysis,"A little background, I've always had sleep paralysis and I've spoken to my parents and my dad had it too. It started when I was little and grew more frequent as I got into high school, my worst was senior year and now I am a freshman in college and haven't gotten it yet except for right now when I took a nap. 
But anyway this happened my senior year in high school, as with most of my episodes it happened after school and after a long track practice when I come home, eat and pass out on the couch in my basement from exhaustion. I fall asleep on my back which is my most vulnerable position for sleep paralysis. I'm falling into a deep sleep and about an hour later I ""wake up"" I look around the room and there is a single light on in my dark basement and I look in the corner to see a long, tall shadowy figure. Even though he didn't has a face or eyes I knew he was staring at me, as soon as I tried to move I couldn't, I was frozen and knew exactly what was going on. A gigantic weight had been placed on my entire body but a second force from behind the couch and I was unable to move anything. I tried to scream and scream as loud as I could to get the attention of anyone or anything (my dog) but I was unable to move. I started to wiggle writhe to try to wake myself up and get out of this room, it was impossible. For what felt like 30 minutes I was attempting to scream and move and eventually I rolled over and hit the floor. I felt my entire body hit the floor with a force and even heard my mom who was in the next room over say something like ""are you okay"".  Directly after that I woke up, with a pounding headache, fast breathing and teary eyed in the exact same position I fell asleep in with the plate of crumbs on my legs.

Sleepparalysis,"Last night I experienced sleep paralysis for the first time. It only lasted maybe two minutes, but mentally was one of the most interesting experiences I'd ever had.

The thing I noticed the most was that prior to the paralysis my dreams were incredibly vivid. I remember them almost entirely and I felt like I had actually lived them.

When it hit it felt like my mind still existed half in my dream, but I knew I was awake. I couldn't move, which was i just don't even have the words to explain. I always thought paralysis would feel like I had no connection with my body, but this felt like I was sending messages and there was no one awake at the office to receive them. All I could do was blink and breath. For some reason I was convinced my younger brother was sharing my bed with me for the night (relates to the dream I had) so I tried to breath very loudly for him to notice, but of course he wasn't there.

Then I had the hallucinations, there were two objects I was convinced turned to demons. I just closed my eyes and focused on breathing, but I'll be honest I was panicking pretty bad.

But when I woke up everything was exactly the same. Even to the sound of my breathing on my blanket the was kinda pressed against my nose. I'm always on my back when it happens.

Sleepparalysis,It's 5 AM and I just fought my way out of SP again. I guess I find posting this and reading posts here comforting. This time was pretty scary because the nightmares leading up to the sleep paralysis were so scary. I won't really describe those but for me the nightmares kind of lead up to the sp. The sleep paralysis started when I heard some faint music that suddenly started blasting into my ear for a few seconds. I jolted because of the music but couldn't wake up and so I struggled trying to move my feet and neck. To add to the creepiness i kept hearing the tv upstairs (it's on right now) and thinking it was my mother talking or explaining stuff to my sister. I was also dreaming that this was going on while I was in my childhood room. Real weird stuff. It felt like I could get my head half way off the pillow before I lost and fell back to the pillow. I don't know if this was me dreaming that or actually getting my head off the pillow. It felt hard to breathe but that feeling didn't last long. I've got a comforting show on tv now and I'm just scared to go back to sleep lol. The good news is I haven't had SP in a while....

Sleepparalysis,"Last night I was trying to lucid dream and think I had sleep paralysis. I was lying still on my back and identified the rollover signal, but I ignored it. Then I get my muscles weaken a bit and a very slight (not as heavy as most people describe) pushing sensation on my chest. I recognized what it was because my heart started beating super fast and it felt much longer than 30 seconds. I recognized what it was immediately and just closed my eyes and focused on my breathing. I still had a decent amount of fear (some irrational, most of hallucinating a demon because I can’t handle scary shit) but no hallucination or sense that someone else was in my room. Did hear a chair move downstairs and it was 2am, but I think that was just a random noise. I just had my eyes closed and looked straight up. Worth noting I didn’t make a pronounced effort to move in this stage because I heard that trying to move can activate hallucinations. Anyways the sleep paralysis eventually subsided, my body still felt limp, but my mind was so focused on the sleep paralysis I just felt awake afterwards.

Sleepparalysis,"I occasionally experience SP. I can only ever recall it happening when I'm napping during the day. I've read where this is the case for many people, but I have a strange twist that I haven't seen anyone mention before although I know I can't be the only one. Sometimes when in and out of naps I can consciously induce sleep paralysis. I'll have my arms and legs pulled closed to my body and be very still. I am barely conscious but can trigger a tingling numbing sensation throughout my whole body. It's hard to explain, but it's like I calm my mind and think now and it starts. It starts from my head and runs down through my whole body. I believe this is the release of atonia? If I am still enough before long the tingling weakens and I can't move. I usually start to panic here and try my hardest to move until I snap out of it and wake up (my body). Other times I'll slip into a dream that I usually have a strong recollection of and I bet I could control if I was better at lucid dreaming. These episodes can happen multiple times during a nap session. I will often fade in and out of dreams and SP states.

Sleepparalysis,"Has anyone discovered any methods to either curb the chance of getting a sleep paralysis episode or snap out of an episode while in it? 
As a child I was a very lucid dreamer. I enjoyed dreaming as I could - to an extent - dream of what I want. But ever since experiencing a traumatic event in my life I started to experience sleep paralysis, where I no longer have control. In the past couple years my episodes have been getting more frequent, so if anyone has any solutions please share.

Some solutions that help me: 
- fall asleep on my side rather than on my back
- sleep with my boyfriend (I’ve only ever experienced an episode once while sleeping with someone) 
- sleep with a nightlight (I find my episodes are worse without a light on)

Sleepparalysis,"
Reddit, 
I️ have been experiencing sleep paralysis for as long as I️ can remember, so when I️ found the subreddit I️ was pretty happy. 

As I’ve searched this sub though, I️ have seen a lot of confusion and lack of clarification on the different types of sleep paralysis. I️ wanted to make a post that cleared siome things up for everyone. Here, I️ will outline the three general types.

“Sleep paralysis is a condition characterized by full or semi-conscious waking during sleep, despite an inability to move and/or speak.”

1. Intruder Hallucinations (Sensed Presence)
People who experience this type of hallucination often refer to sensing the presence of another person/entity during their sleep paralysis. If you experience these things, you may have the ‘Intruder Hallucination’ paralysis:
-Auditory hallucinations: 
This involves hearing voices, noises, or other odd sounds.
-Sensing another entity: 
You may sense that another (typically evil) presence is within close proximity.
-Visual hallucinations: 
Some people claim to have seen an intruder or evil entity during their hallucinatory experience.

2. Incubus Hallucinations 
The “Incubus” type of sleep paralysis may best be related to: chest pressure, difficulty breathing, and in some cases, perception of physical pain.  Some associated symptoms may include:
ody pressure: Individuals report feeling intense pressure on some part of their body.
-Breathing difficulties: 
In most cases, people report having a tough time breathing, and usually attribute it to chest or body pressure.
-Chest pressure: 
The body pressure is most commonly reported as being directly on the center of the chest.
-Pain: 
Many people perceive pain on the area in which they feel pressure or within surrounding muscle groups.
-Suffocation: 
It is common to believe that you are being suffocated during an “incubus” hallucination.
-Thoughts of death: 
People may feel threatened as if they’re going to die as a result of an evil entity such as a witch, demon, or alien.

3. Unusual Bodily Experiences (Vestibular-Motor Hallucinations)
Those reporting “unusual bodily experiences” during sleep paralysis may feel as if they are entering another realm of existence.  Some people with unusual bodily experiences claim to have had out-of-body experiences (OOBEs), felt as if they were flying, or as if they were floating in space. Common characteristics include:
-Emotional bliss: 
It is common for those with unusual bodily experiences to report feeling particularly blissful, happy, or content.
-Fictitious motor movements: 
People may believe that they are moving their body and/or walking around, despite the fact that they’re asleep.
-Floating sensations: 
Some individuals may feel as if their body is floating in space without being bound to gravity.
-Flying sensations: 
Others report feeling as if they were flying during their sleep paralysis.
-Inertial forces: 
People may report a variety of experiences including: falling, lifting, spinning, swirling, accelerating, or decelerating. The most common happen to be flying and floating, but others are documented.
-Lightheadedness: 
Some people report a significant degree of lightheadedness or dizziness during unusual bodily experiences.
-Out-of-body experiences: 
It is common for those with recurrent episodes of sleep paralysis to have out-of-body experiences.
-Remote viewing: 
This is defined as “autoscopy” or the hallucinatory experience of “seeing” yourself from an external, third-person.

Sleepparalysis,"Before, I was lucky. I never go into sleep paralysis waking up. only going to sleep. And usually it's caused by whatever position I'm sleeping in. And sometimes I catch it's happening so I jolt quickly before it happens. When it does happen. I usually hear voices and I feel things. But I never saw anything. Because my eyes are thankfully closed. 

This time it was the usual, I fell asleep straight on my back. I try to avoid that, but I was exhausted after a long night. I didn't think of it. I hear the usual vague noises and I feel something feeling up my legs and crotch. I'm used to it at this point.

But this time.. something different happened. I heard a voice... A voice that was actually making words. It sounded like that thing from the Enricks website. The video attached to that website that was associated with Lost. That's what it sounded like... It sounded... Angry. After a few seconds. I recognized what the words were .. he..she...it? Was saying ""I hate you"" over and over again. But more aggressive each time.

And then I saw it. From the shadows of my eyelids a face emerged. Some horrible semi-human black and white face that didn't quite scare me but made me feel a sense of dread like no other. I always thought I was safe because my eyes are closed. But now I'm not. 


I feel so terrified and alone... I've never had visual hallucinations. This was a completely new experience. Is this my version of""the shadow man"" finally greeting me? I just... I don't know. Why the sudden change? I'm terrified.

Am I better off opening my eyes next time? I know I'm capable of it. Sometimes I slightly Creek em open to try and jolt me out of it quicker. I have the feeling that if I really pushed it I could go wide and jolt myself awake.

Sleepparalysis,"I've had multiple strange experiences during this year. Tonight, I experienced something I can only describe as sinister, dark, and disturbing. 

I only experience paralysis when I sleep in a certain position, and this time, I didnt. First it started with a dream. I talked with my professor of anatomy. Nothing unusual. Then, I was suddenly at my uncle's house, where I encountered an old school friend. We decided to go to the balcony, where we had a small chat. She talked of some friend, and metioned she was possesed and needed an exorcism. In my mind, I thought I too was possesed, but didnt mention it. She pointed over to the mountains and I saw beautiful peaks covered in ice, a sudden urge of climbing then emerged inside me. I glanced back at her and poof....she was gone. Suddenly, it all went dark. At this point I knew I was in bed. A black ""energy"" began to form in front of me. Like various blasts or strings of energy, moving in various directions, converging into a single thing. It felt sinister, I could sense evil within. Ive always been interested in sleep paralysis and the paranormal, so Ive mentalized myself not to fear these strange phenomena. As it was forming, I tried to analyze my situation. I am an objective and cold-headed person whenever I need to be. I was looking directly at it, and I felt I needed to show confidence, so I smirked at it, I literally smiled, as to send a message ""I am as sinister and do not fear you"". Sounds fucked up I know, but for a moment it empowered me. The words possesion, repression, and shadow (as in Jung's concept) popped in my head. I smiled. Then my head started to shake in a freakishly, repeated demeanor, in a Mr. Anderson (matrix) way. At this point I was freaked out. Whenever I have sleep paralysis, I have the strength to will its end, by moving small muscles and my ankles and wrists. I had to turn on the TV. I am a skeptical man, who likes to explore ideas of the psyche. The most rational approach for an explanation, it was some sort of manifestation of my shadow (Carl Jung), wanting to tell me something. The best ways to describe this experience are sinister, macabre, plain disturbing, and curious. I am a strong person, and willing to experience more of these, each time with due courage, to learn  more about the unconscious. 

Any comments? Thanks for reading. I have more of these strange situations if youd like to hear them.

Sleepparalysis,"You know that feeling when you’re sort of half awake and somebody comes into the room to wake you up? 
The air seems to move as they make their way around to you. The weight on the bed shifts as they sit on an unoccupied edge.  And then you get that tingling feeling on your shoulder as if you can almost predict where their hand is about to make contact with your skin...
I get this feeling a lot. As if there’s someone with me in my room, watching me sleep like a mother would with her newborn. I’m not exactly afraid of it, but I’m always frozen when it happens. I want to roll over, prove to myself that nobody is there, but physically can’t. Only recently I learned that if I can say “Go away”, it works just as well. 
But last night it was different. Last night I heard a scream. It was so sharp and precise that it sounded as if it came from directly in front of me. This time my entire body jerked awake and physically recoiled in fear. I was the only one home.

Sleepparalysis,"I wanted to share a Sleep Paralysis experience that I had a little over a year ago.

I've experienced sleep paralysis and the shadow man before, but this was a unique one. 
A year and a half ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and a few months into treatment she began experiencing some side effects.

One morning around that time, I woke up in my room and everything was hazy. I asked my boyfriend to grab me a glass of water. He did, and as I was sipping it I could hear him saying ""Your leg! Your leg!"" But his voice was muffled, as if he were talking underwater.
I suddenly felt soaking wet and realized that the right side of my body was going numb. I had dropped the glass of water all over myself. I tried to answer my boyfriend but it was as though the words were melting out of my mouth.
I started stiffening and spasming until I fell out of bed.
At this point I *actually* woke up to a text from my mom, asking me to call her. I did, and she told me that she was experiencing Neuropathy in her right leg (numbness and tingling). She said it was so bad that it woke her up. 

I haven't had sleep paralysis since, but I have continued to have sympathy symptoms for anything my mom and/or my sister experience haha.

Sleepparalysis,"I have had sleep paralysis before but never experienced anything this major. Honestly kinda thinking it isn't sleep paralysis it might be some other dream type. 

It happened this morningI woke up to my alarm ringing and I vividly remember turning it off and everything after. I forgot to turn off the 5 am one the night before. After that I kinda just sit there just to wake up and look at my window and my TV is suddenly right above my bed (usually is mounted on the wall near my computer. Which is in he back of my room). In my mind I didn't really think anything of it but it turned on and I was wanting to play a game (if anyone is curious in my mind I was thinking Dayz) 
and I did but I opened the wrong game(a pixelated game like hotline Miami). As it opens a noise came from my window and I saw a black figure above my lamp which had been off. I was so scared. A sentence came on the game saying something on the lines of ""the devil is now here"". It didn't say that exactly, it had three words in it but In my mind I knew what it meant. My sister then comes in my room to ask if I'm okay and hops on the bed. I tell her what just happened and look at my window only to look at her again and everything I saw was gone. The TV is back in its right place the figure was gone and my window curtains were closed. ",,0,Had a Scary sleep paralysis.

I woke up about an hour ago, laying on my side, half buried under blankets. I don't know if I wasn't able to move but I felt like my whole body was weighed down. It was almost nice, I felt peaceful and warm because it was cold and the window was open. I felt sluggish and rigid. 

All I could see was my room, and it was very dark. Darker than usual. Things were fuzzy and my vision swirled ever so slightly. Things almost felt like they were tinted red, too. I heard this very odd metallic rumbling in my head, above and behind me, like it was coming not only from inside my head but from the wall. 

I kind of morphed in and out of conciousnes and woke up, able to move. I felt oddly refreshed and nice. Is this sleep paralysis? Has anyone actually not had a negative experience with it?

Sleepparalysis,"So as the title explains, I’ve been trying to learn how to lucid dream. Before I continue I’d like to preface that I’ve had SP once before (very mild and short.) 

I’m not even sure if lucid dreaming and having sleep paralysis correlate in the slightest but I swear that I have activated this phenomenon some how.

Lately I’ve been realizing that I’m in a dream, and try my hardest to stay “dreaming” while simultaneously trying to alter my dream because hey, thats what lucid dreaming is about right? Anyways I usually end up waking up or if I’m unlucky I’ll enter some sort SP state, since I am a giant pussy I usually keep my eyes closed when I realize I am paralyzed seeing as I know I’m having an episode and I do not want to figure out what sort of fucked up shit my mind can come up with to scare me. 

However,  my last “episode” really scared the shit out of me. The usual happened, fell asleep, realized I was dreaming, tried to control the dream and ended up “waking up” to person coming into my room. I live with 3 other of my boys, so I screamed to get the fuck out, the person walked to the foot of my bed (I just felt the presence) and somehow I just knew that it was a girl. I told the girl to get in bed with me and then she did. At this point it felt normal and I don’t think I was paralyzed although I never tried to move or see who the girl was. Next thing I know I lay on my back and the girl teleports under the covers right in-between my legs. She “looked up at me” but since her hair covered her face (just like the grudge) I could not see her face. At this point I realized I was paralyzed and was panicking. She slowly crept closer to my face and started to kiss my neck. It was tickling me so fucking bad it was almost torture. She then moved her face so much closer to mine that I could SMELL and FEEL her breath. It smelled just like breath and then I blinked and she was gone, but I still smelled and felt the hot air around my face.

I was absolutely fucked. I have not tried all that much to lucid dream as I am absolutely terrified from that. 

Is it possible/normal to feel and smell breath like I did???

So one of the common things I will see is a dark figure standing by the corner of my bed, It has no face and it just stands there staring at me. I can slightly move my hands while trying to crawl off my bed but I can’t. Now there was one time when it actually spoke to me, I couldn’t catch onto what it was saying. Whatever it was , it felt negative, like it was trying to suck out all the positive energy from my soul. 

During Sleep Paralysis , I’ve also seen something more calm, a man in an uniform, this was a difference sense from the dark figure, sure I was afraid but it wasn’t the same negative feeling I was getting.

I decided to get some sage for my room, and considering talking to a psychic or sleep specialist.

Sleepparalysis,"I used to experience false awakenings often ever since I was a kid. I never googled it before and didn't realize before today that it actually had a name. Or even that other people experienced it!

For me, it was always waking up in the middle of the night to find everything normal and in its proper place. Then I'd hear someone in my house - maniacal laughter from the closet or the sound of a window breaking. After what would feel like 30 seconds or so, I'd ""wake up"" and then do it all over again. I'd realize what was happening but breaking the loop felt really difficult. Like a barrier I had to try to push myself through. The false awakenings were usually followed by sleep paralysis. Once I did finally wake up for real, I had to keep myself from falling asleep again or else it would start over. All in all, it was terrifying.

Then we got a security system. I haven't had any false awakenings or sleep paralysis since then! I'm hoping it isn't a coincidence. Like having the security system has alleviated my anxiety enough to help with the sleep issues I was having.

Sleepparalysis,"Little backstory here, I’ve been dealing with sleep paralysis since freshman or sophomore year of high school. I’m halfway through college now, and I’ve dealt with it ever since. 

At first it was incredibly terrifying because of the fact that I had no idea what it was. But after doing some research on it and figuring out what it was, I started to take advantage of it whenever it happened and I would lucid dream and kind of just try to enjoy the experience. Only two of my experiences have been truly terrifying, and they both involved the shadow man. But I just woke up from a nap and I had a sleep paralysis experience that lasted ~10 minutes and I saw a shadow woman. 

It was horrifying. I’ve learned to just try to keep my eyes closed during SP, because I don’t have control of the hallucinations. But this time, I don’t know why, about 2 minutes into SP my eyes felt like they were being forced open. As they opened I could see this figure right next to my bed staring right back at me. She was a short (maybe 4’10?) shadow girl just standing right next to my bed about 2-3 feet away from my face. She was short, had no face (it was dark in my room and she was a black shadow-girl so i couldn’t see any facial features) and she had long black hair.

She looked directly at me and tried to convince me that she was my girlfriend. I can’t remember her voice, or even her saying that, but I know that she did. I tried telling her she wasn’t my girlfriend and that none of this was real, but after I said that she violently grabbed my leg and just squeezed her fingers and nails into my leg. But the thing was, it fucking hurt. I remember being in the middle of SP and feeling actually pain from this. After grabbing my leg for a few seconds, she got super close to my face and squeezed even tighter. 

After fighting this for a little, I finally woke up but quickly realized I was still dreaming. I would wake up and walk to my living room, but something would seem off. The set up of the living room, the physics of certain things going on, etc. so I would pinch myself and feel no pain and immediately know that I was still dreaming. Then I’d wake back up, and the same thing would happen. This happened about 5 times in a row. 

Eventually I went up to my mom (who I always talk about my SP to) and grabbed her face and said “Mom I’m in sleep paralysis and I need you to come wake me up. I know you aren’t my real mom and this is a dream, but if you can somehow hear this please come and wake me up.” About 20 seconds after this I immediately woke up and had a super fast heartbeat and felt extremely physically drained. 

Sorry for the long post and if it wasn’t super easy to read, I’ve never been very good at putting these things into words. Hopefully some of you read this and can comment some replies to it or some similar stories that have happened to you. This was definitely the worst SP experience I ever had.

Sleepparalysis,"Got home from class around 8 at night, changed and went to bed. Things started out innocent. I can remember chasing/playing tag with a little kid in a hotel.

I chase behind, but when I get outside, the kid was nowhere to be found. Confused, I looked around, looked up and below me, but I couldn't find him. I then heard a giggling/laughing behind me. I turn around and see a little girl dead, hung by a noose, neck broken and everything. But she was staring at me wide-eyed, laughing.

Sleepparalysis,I remember my first time experiencing sleep paralysis probably 1 or 2 years ago and feeling absolutely horrified and all I kept doing was trying to move my body and trying to scream for help. Most of the time when experiencing sleep paralysis happens to me when I'm laying down and forcing myself to stay awake and when I feel the moment that I'm about to fall asleep I force myself awake but in doing so triggers my sleep paralysis. This happened some time during the summer or maybe during one of the holidays and it became pretty normal to the point where I had them for what seemed like every other night and sometimes I have the same reaction as the first or I just get annoyed.

Sleepparalysis,"My mind keeps lingering on a ""dream"" I had about a week ago. Lately I've been experiencing a number of ""eureka"" moments during the short span of time between being asleep and being fully awake. There's always that one groggy second as you first open your eyes and in recent weeks I've been fortunate to have come up with some pretty great answers to some persistent issues in that single moment. One instance, however, was nothing like the rest. 

One night I awoke to a feeling of massive pressure on my chest. I couldn't move and strained to breathe as I felt my body press into my mattress. Right above me there was a dark figure with amber colored eyes speaking in a manner that I could only hear not through my ears but in the back of my head. I can't for the life of me remember what it was saying and why it was on top of me  but I remember staring back and shouting to whatever it was that I was not afraid. Again and again I yelled that I was not afraid, despite being unable to move my body or breathe correctly. I tried to ""stand"" my ground and regardless it continued speaking whatever it was speaking to me. As I stared more and more into its horrible eyes and jagged grin, I began to wonder if I was lying to myself about not being scared and was in fact terrified for my life.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello!  So I started having episodes of sleep paralysis when I was 11 or 12. I continued to experience them consistently but there was no pattern I could discern to try to make adjustments to my sleeping routine.  

After college I ended up taking some solo motorcycle trips and I thought it would be fun to exclusively hammock camp on my travels.  I got such great sleep I decided to be a weirdo and get rid of my bed and totally convert to a hammock.

It's been well over two years since I made the change and I've never had an episode of SP while sleeping in a hammock that I can recall and I have had SP when I had to sleep in a regular bed during this time.  It's certainly not a cure but it's a dang comfy band-aid.  I figured it if works for me it's gotta work for some other folks too!  Try sleeping in a hammock!

Also, my SP experiences include sounds, tactile sensations(but never pain), visions/sight and the classic malevolent beings.  From my impressions I do not experience extreme/intense SP as some poor souls do.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello, I'm very new to this thread. I believe I have had a recent episode of sleep paralysis, but through the day after it happened I am not sure if it was actually sleep paralysis. I will describe what happened.

I remember waking up, sleeping on my side. I was kind of in a trance, my eyes were still closed (or at least it was very dark) and I remember just laying there. I was aware that I was sleeping, and I instantly thought: ""Oh, this might be sleep paralysis?"" 

I tried to move my toes and my fingers, but I could not move them at all. I could barely feel movement. I tried to call out for my mom but I couldn't move my mouth as well. I remember watching a video about keeping my eyes closed, so I did (whether they were closed in the first place, I do not know). I tried not to panic as well, attempting to move my fingers and toes but to no success. Why I question this is how many people describe their experience as pure fear, seeing very scary hallucinations or sounds. I didn't really hear anything or see anything. The whole time, I was trying to remind myself to not panic. After what seemed like forever, I somehow felt that I snapped out of it, and I instantly went back to sleep again. I was too tired to think about it until the next morning. 

But the question is did I really have it?

Sleepparalysis,"I still remember my first experience with what the internet tells me is ""sleep paralysis"". The first time it occurred was in 2012, I went to sleep and had a weird serious of levels to a dream. It was like a dream inside of a dream. I woke up from the third level (a dream about my friend's husband and how he and I were working of fighter jets together, something neither of us are skilled enough to do) to a ""dream"" about a little girl. I knew I was dreaming but couldn't wake up from this dream, and a true fear set in. That panic that slowly creeps up and takes over your whole body and you can't move, you can't speak, you can't do anything. You know you're dreaming, but how do you wake yourself up from this horrible place. I remember finally coming out of it, scared, ""what the hell was that?"" I quickly went to the internet to ask the obviously questions: am I dying, did I die, will this kill me? Things like that. You know, the normal questions. Google assured me it was sleep paralysis, and if I wanted it could lucid dream (that sounds cool right?).

Over the course of a few months, the ""paralysis"" would come and go, never an onset sign, never any warning. Each time telling a different piece of story to this little girl, who came to me in my most vulnerable time. She was 5, maybe 6. Different pieces of her life because visible to me through this  weird ""sleep paralysis"". Each time would end with her saying, chanting really ""I'm behind you. I'm behind you."" I always knew it was time to wake up then because the numbing feeling would set in, the inability to move, speak, the paralysis... I knew I could never see this child because she wasn't good, she was just a child, she was something worse. 

I'm not sure if it is sleep paralysis, because for me it's not just me in my home, my room, where ever it is I feel asleep at, it's more. It's always layers of dreams. Sometimes i've done the normal sleep paralysis thing. The feeling something's in the room with you, the feeling of it grabbing you, crawling on to you, raping you, taunting you by lifting your limbs. Hell, i've even been possessed by something in these weird layers where I fight for  the right of my body. Screaming, thrashing, begging, my inner thoughts racing telling me to wake up, I need to wake up before it gets me. Before something bad happens, before this thing ends my life and I'm trapped her with it. But back to the reoccuring one. Her story played out, I know how it went, each one a little more and more about what happened to her. Each one as frightful, as paralysing, and uncomfortable as the next. I know her story and i'll share it with you, in hopes to gather some kind of insight, some kind of techniques to help... 

She's 5, or 6 ( as mentioned from before). Her family lives in an old farm house, the year is unknown, they abuse her, starve her, hate her existence. They lock her in her room from the outside, with a pad lock. She eventually expires there, alone in her room... Her parents know they'll go to jail, so the board her room up, like it was never there. They skip town, develope different identities, never letting anyone know about their child and the horrible things the did to her. She was alone, forgotten,left to rot in the hidden room behind the walls... All of this I dreamed, through the course of months (years) never seeing the little girl, always wake up before that. The fear always setting in with her taunting me with ""I'm behind you, I'm behind you."" Until one night, (two maybe three years ago) I seen her. 

I'm exploring an old farm house, abandoned, decrepit. The windows broken, the house in shambles. Graffiti on the walls from pervious teenagers and their mischief. I make my way up stairs, nothing unusual, nothing impressive, until I fall through the floor. Something wraps around my leg and I'm hanging inches from the living room, spinning, that's when she comes. That's when she starts her usual ""I'm behind you"" except this time she's there, with each spin she gets closer and closer and closer, and the need to wake up stronger each time, the screaming the need to move any part of my body to wake myself up. Come on, shaynanigans, you know this is a dream. Do it. You know you can't see her... And that's when she grabbed me, that's when she stopped me in mid turn, and said ""I'm here"". And she was. Decomposed, her tiny body, in a tattered old dress, she had me, I was done for. And that's when I could move my arm, and then the rest of my body and I bolted up right in bed. Years of torment from this child and I had finally seen her. I wished I never had.


Now, you've read some of my experiences, I want to share some more information with you about them. They always give me headaches and I always feel like when I'm awake, that the horrible creepy thing we can't see is still in the room with me, so much I have to get up and leave that room. I feel like the creature is watching me, waiting for me to drift off back to sleep so it can get me again, so this time it can finish it's job, claim my soul, and use my body as it's own. I'm always more exhausted then I was before I went to sleep.  I'm begging someone, somewhere, has a similar experience, some tips, something to help me. I hate this feeling. How do I know when it's coming? Are there any tips to prevent it?

Sleepparalysis,"Hey all,

Reading your stories over the last few months has helped me come to grips with what I’m experiencing. However I’ve noticed things in myself that I wanted to see if the community was experiencing. 

My girlfriend and I sleep together almost every night while at college, and the paralysis stays mostly at bay. If it does happen it’s in dream and not hallucinations, which for me is much easier to handle. However I went home for thanksgiving break they came back and got worse by the night. Even a post thanksgiving dinner nap slipped me into an episode. Does anyone else experience some relief when sleeping with a partner?

Recently I have noticed that I can move very slowly during an episode, something that used to bring me out of the paralysis but no longer does. Even what feels like repeated hits to the face won’t do it, only feeling like I’m going to throw myself off the bed. Is it my perception of the dreams changing or is it something in my sleep cycle?

I have my Fitbit to track my sleep cycles and it’s been really interesting to see how it records the episodes, I can post the graphs if anyone is interested.

After a while of trying to move, I finally managed to move my hand and tried to fall back asleep.. but as soon as I started to drift into sleep there was this really loud buzzing sound in my head so I woke up again cuz the buzzing scared me. 

I kept trying to sleep, but the buzzing came back as soon as I'd start falling asleep. So I was just laying there unable to move and unable to sleep..

 At one point I tried to ignore the buzzing, but it got louder and louder. I felt like I was losing my mind. That went on for some time till I finally fell asleep.

Sleepparalysis,"Years ago, I tried to learn to lucid dream but was never successful. This is how I know of sleep paralysis, though I'd never experienced it.

I was dreaming of fighting some kind of invisible earth elemental with magic inside a huge hollowed-out tree, but decided the fight was taking too long. I exit the tree and I'm ""awake"".

My room is utterly dark and I can barely open my eyes and I can't move. Suddenly, I notice there's something small---the size of a large house cat---half on top of me. At first I thought it was the earth elemental, but then ""remembered"" I was no longer dreaming.

The animal on top of me is preoccupied fiddling with something noisily and it's moving feet have that comforting effect of when my cat from my childhood would sit on top of me while I slept and would kneed my bed blanket. But how is an animal in my apartment?

With great effort, I open my eyes fully and I see the dark silhouette of a racoon examining something in its hands. At first, I'm kind of happy, but then I realize it might have rabies, so I decide to get up and, if it nears, to somehow use my blanket to impede its path.

I try and try to get up to do this, but I can't . . . and I partially don't want to because I love racoons and it's cool to have one so close. But finally I move to get up and that's when I woke up for real.

Anyone else have positive experiences? The experiences people have with SP make me nervous that I may start experiencing it more regularly . . . but maybe I'll be lucky and mostly have benign experiences like this.

Sleepparalysis,"Hello.  Every night I get something similar to sleep paralysis but I’m not sure I can call it that way. 
I never wake up to sleep paralysis, but my body does paralyze when I’m trying to sleep. When my body is paralyzed I can move my eyes and some parts of my body like my fingers. I don’t see anything out of place, I rarely feel a presence in my room, but I do hear things, like the sound you hear when there’s a strong wind blowing at your face or even a telephone ring. 
After the initial shock I can calm myself down and make an effort to move, and that’s when I can snap out of my paralysis. They only last like a minute or maybe two (but I get like 4 every night).
So is this a weird kind of sp or is it something completely unrelated? Does anyone have similar experiences like this?

Sleepparalysis,"Hey guys, has anyone ever had anything abnormal occur during a sleep paralysis episode- that you didn't find out about until you woke up???

I just had a sp dream that something heavy (that felt evil) was grabbing me by my legs and around my hips trying to pull me from the bed. I kept trying to scream but could only produce a faint squeak. I kept squeaking over and over until my boyfriend woke up next to me and was comforting me. I started crying and explaining to him what happened, and then the evil thing grabbed me and rolled me over - I was not awake! In fact I hadn't move or even squeaked at all in real life. And realizing that woke me up, for real this time. I flipped the covers off of me in one swift motion. I went in the other room and cuddled my dog, which always makes me feel better. When I went back to my room I went to grab my phone before my alarm went off so it wouldn't wake up my boyfriend- my phone had been under my pillow while I was sleeping but was no longer there. I looked down between the wall and the bed and it had fallen under the bed. This occurs regularly. The lights in the room were ON and I could see it clearly. I went to the side of the bed to pull it out and it was not under there. Confused I got on the bed to look down on it again and my phone was ON TOP of the overturned covers exactly where the evil thing had been.... I was AWAKE when I saw the phone under the bed 20 seconds before.... And I had climbed up on the bed before and it was NOT THERE. 

I had another sp experience a while back that I was being stabbed with a knife in my side repeatedly(in my dream.) My dream was occurring but I was also acutely aware that I was in my bedroom, I could see the ceiling, and I could NOT move no matter how hard I kept trying. When I finally woke up I had a scratch on my side where I thought I was being stabbed and it was bleeding. To this day I have a scar there even though it was a small scratch. I am SURE that I was completely unable to move and could not have scratched myself.

Sleepparalysis,"Ok folks, I made a little start at an FAQ. Please offer feedback, make corrections, addition etc.  


&amp;nbsp;


* Q. Was what I just experience sleep paralysis?
* A. Since we are not doctors and can't give you a diagnosis, the best way to answer your own question is to **read some posts** here or over at /r/sleepparalysislogs. Feel free to share your experience and get some support. 


&amp;nbsp;


* Q. I heard a loud sound during an SP episode with or without seeing things. Is that normal?
* A. Yes. Pretty common; bangs, crashes, buzzing, screeching, voices, whispers, breathing, growling, etc.  

&amp;nbsp;


* Q. I thought during sleep paralysis you couldn't move at all, but I opened my eyes, or did x. 
* A. During SP you are in a dreamlike state, or on the edge of one, and the experiences are often vivid and intense. For example you might have seen a dark figure during an episode, and might recollect struggling mightily to open your eyes, or remember seeing your room at some point during the episode... but were your eyes actually open during any of that?... almost certainly not.

Sleepparalysis,"So there are two sides to this stories the first being my roommate’s:
He walked in late at night as usual when I’m already fast asleep suddenly I start saying words/sounds very quickly but incomprehensibly. He later told me it sounded like sleep talking mixed with rapping or speaking in Tongues. 

My side: 
I am asleep I come into a daze nearly waking when I hear a noise(presumably my roommate opening the door) suddenly I feel as though I’m yanked back there are flashing patterns on the inside of my eyelids and a weight on my chest. I feel paralyzed except suddenly I feel words pouring out of me. I can’t remember what they were just that I disagreed with what I was saying and that I couldn’t stop myself from saying it. Then I don’t remember anything. I remember feeling terrified which is really rare for me. I pretty much never have night mares. I asked my roommate about it this morning and the above story was what he told me. 

I guess I’m wondering exactly what this was. It felt very similar to what I’ve heard sleep paralysis feels like. With the weight on the chest and all. But I’ve never heard of someone being able to move but not control their actions like sleep talking. It was really weird. It felt how I would imagine being possessed or mind controlled would feel like. Of course I’m not insinuating that this is the case just using it as a reference. 

So mostly I’m just looking to see what insight people have. Any similar experiences?

And just suddenly, I felt sleep paralysis like someone is stopping my body to move and just suddenly, my lower body is being lifted. It was creepy. I’m still getting chills thinking about it. My lowe body is getting chills, and I couldn’t shout. I was calling for my mother. I was doing everything. Getting out my tongue / moving my hand for her to see.

OTHER SP EXPERIENCES:

I think I never really experienced sleep paralysis irl. It’s always in dream. And I always hear things outside my room whenever I dream about getting sleep paralysis. Either someone is in the toilet or my father watching tv or shouting outside because of how loud it is. Yup, once, he was shouting outside because of how noisy it is and I was trying to say it’s not me but I couldn’t shout and say it to him. Things like these. In today’s dream, I just heard a flush in the toilet.

Sleepparalysis,"Why?
Cos when I'm living my cozy, sinful life, I am alright.

But whenever I start getting closer to God, like when I am trying to live a Godly life. It starts.

I can tell when I am about to get paralyzed in my sleep. The cats come close to my windows in the middle of the night, then they start crying like babies. Can you imagine two, three or four cats crying like babies next to your window, in the middle of the night, when all you want is to sleep. Cos you been trying to please God? Where were they prior to my change of lifestyle?
As if they are my wicked guardian gods.
And when you wake up to chase them, they run away, but once you get back to bed, they come and start crying. Like They are having fun out your pain.

Whenever I tried ignoring them, and forced myself to sleep, I entered into sleep paralysis. This happened more than 11 times. I couldn't talk when paralyzed, but I could still mumble.

I could always sense that I was about to be paralyzed, I felt it in my body. It used to happen at the border of consciousness and unconsciousness. What other call the altered state of mind. At that point when your body is making the switch. Only your mind wakes up, but the cats, whoever controlled them kept my physical body asleep.

It felt embarrassing for people to tell me that I was mumbling for dear life, while my body was uncontrollably shaking.

At time I could remember the experience, at times I was completely unconscious.

Nowadays, whenever I sense it, I immediately pray. It works.

But in the past, that wasn't the case. I didn't know how to pray.

I would lay paralyzed, mumbling for dear life, whilst all my awestruck roommates watched.

My door was unlocked so I wanted to lock it. I kept telling my body to sit up and go and lock it, but it wasn't responding. Then I freaked out. I was able to struggle against the paralysis slightly, felt like I was being restrained but eventually I'm able to sit up. The whole time I'm trying to scream ""Help"" but I can't get the words out, plus I have a sore throat that feels intensified. I'm able to make some noise though, mostly rasping. 

Then I suddenly go into a dream where some of my suite mates are comforting me in the common area cause I told them what happened. And once again I wake up in my bed, and my body feels like at any moment it will lapse into paralysis again so I jumped out of bed and turned on my lamp.

Sleepparalysis,"Hey sorry if this is not an appropriate post for this subreddit but I can’t seem to find the answers I’m looking for on google.

My whole life I could count on one hand the amount of times I’ve experienced Sleep Paralysis and now I’m 26 and just in the last year I’m suddenly experiencing it more and more frequently. At first it was maybe once or twice a month, but now it’s happening several times a week. Also the hallucinations are becoming more vivid. At first they were just “feeling” a presence and then seeing orbs floating over my head and now last night I saw a man in a white hoodie creeping towards me.

I’m just wondering why or how did I suddenly develop this. Could it be related to stress? Or I’m mostly just worried it could be linked to something physically wrong? I don’t know much about it and google just tells me no ones ever died from it, which is reassuring but it doesn’t tell me if it could be a symptom of something else.

Sleepparalysis,"I experienced sleep paralysis last night for the first time, that’s not the strange part though. Moments before I paralysis began I was downstairs and my bedroom is upstairs. I vividly remember walking through my hallway downstairs then almost instantly I’m in bed wondering what hell is happening. Shortly after I realized what was going on and after about 2 minutes or so I was able to move again. The only reason why I’m posting here is to ask if anybody has experienced something similar?

Sleepparalysis,........or early this morning rather. I was up watching tv at my partners house. We were laying on the sofa and she was laying on top of me asleep. I believe that it was hypnagogic.... because I remember earlier  I felt myself nodding off but woke myself because something felt odd. I can’t explain it. When the experience occurred I was looking straight ahead. I immediately couldn’t breath. It felt like my partner was squeezing the life out of me. I  tried to say her name but because I couldn’t breath... nothing came out. It felt like life was being taken out of my body. I literally thought I was dying.

Sleepparalysis,"My daughter is 9. At least three times in the past 4 months she has had an episode of what her pediatrician says is sleep paralysis. She has referred us to a specialist and we are just waiting for our initial appointment. I have done some research online and haven't found anything similar to what my daughter goes through. Most of what I find is hallucinations and sensations of being held down or not being able to move at all. 

My daughter experiences something a little different. It mostly happens in the early morning hours. Every time she says her teeth ""chatter"" and she can't make them stop. She also says she can't get out of bed because her room is spinning and it makes her dizzy and her eyes roll. Each time, she tells me she has to wait for it all to stop before she can come and get me. 

Last night, she had a nightmare and came to my room. I put her back to bed, we talked about it and I let the family dog sleep in there with her so she would feel better. I didn't stay to watch her fall asleep (it was about 3:45 a.m.) but she told me this morning when I went to wake her up that it happened again after I left, right before she fell asleep. She is on edge lately, afraid it's going to keep happening. Her pediatrician has said that sometimes therapy helps people deal with the anxiety of it all but that at this time it was too early to start all that. 

Does this sound like anything anyone here has experienced with their sleep paralysis? I am just anxious waiting for our appointment and skeptical since what she experiences doesn't seem typical.

Sleepparalysis,"Warning: Semi long post.

Originally, I posted on the lucid dreaming subreddit how I thought sleep paralysis sucked, because I always had a bad experience. I'm interested in astral projection and learned how to on YouTube, but it requires you to know how to induce sleep paralysis. I get sleep paralysis from time to time, but it is always random, so I don't know when the next time I'll get it.

Some of the guides on YouTube require you to lay in bed without moving and concentrate on your breathing until your body falls asleep, but when I do that, I cant seem to keep my mind clear and focused. I end up awake without sleep paralysis, even if I lay in bed for 15+ minutes. What am I doing wrong? 

I know I said sleep paralysis is scary for me, but if I stand still and can use the rope technique or follow another guide on the astral projection subreddit, then I should pop out of my body and travel around. This may sound like pseudo science, but I know someone personally that had random out of body experiences. Real or not, I want to find out for my self. If this should belong on the astral projection subreddit, then I can ask there, but I thought, since I just wanted to know how to induce sleep paralysis, I could ask here.

Should I try the method on laying on my back, or can I lay on my side? Also, if I do the breathing technique, how is the best way of doing it? Do I need a clear mind, or can I think about anything, but focus on breathing slowly? Is there another technique that I could try, such as setting an alarm early and waking up during rem sleep? What methods do you recommend and how should I try them?


TLDR: I want to induce sleep paralysis even though I said it was scary so I can attempt astral projection aka inducing an out of body experience.

Thanks for your time and patience, and again, if this doesn't belong here, I can post on the other subreddit that I mentioned in my post.

Sleepparalysis,"So it’s been roughly 8 months since I’ve experienced any of these things I’ve listed in the title. My life since that time of my life has majorly improved mentally and physiologically. I was depressed and lonely. And it’s was winter, in canada, so very cold and dark. I didn’t have many friends at the time and anxiety was at the peak of how much it has ever taken hold of me. I also felt very empty, wether it was a spiritual emptiness or emotional emptiness I don’t really know, but it could have very well been both due to my casual sex choices. I was sleeping around on tinder, hah, classic. But it left me feeling empty without a drive to live. It sucked my persona right out of me and I felt anxious all the time. It was devastating. 
Anyways, I’m just trying to make a picture of how I was living my life could have maybe affected these strange things that were also happening to me at the time. So let’s start with the bed shaking because that’s what happened first. Occurrences would be separated by a 2-3 period, sometimes more. I would wake up, in the middle of the night to my body tipping side to side due to the bed moving or shaking. I was always laying on my back. It wasn’t an earthquake because I checked the online charts for my area the day after every occurrence. Also, there aren’t any train tracks in my area. When it happened I woke up all confused trying to listen to anything els shaking in my room but it was only my bed and me. It would start, then I’d wake up and it would get stronger. I never got up during its occurrence but laying there, swaying back and forth I started praying to Jesus. I grew up in Christian home by the way. Anyways, after about a solid minute of praying the shaking would finally start to reside, sometimes it would happen again after 5 mins or so, but sometimes not. Bed shaking has happened probably 3-4 times. 
During this time I was also drinking quiet a lot with friends, or just one friend. So one morning I woke up in my bed, slightly hungover but mostly dehydrated to the sound of a very deep manly but ghostly voice saying my name. It was fully audibly. Not like the voice in your head that when you think or silently read. It was in my left ear, 1-2 feet away from me. I woke up instantly frightened. I got up and walked over to my buddy asking if it was him, but we was still asleep, and that also did not sound like him one bit.
Since that last time, I have not experienced any of these symptoms but I have also quit drinking, smoking pot occasionally, and sleeping around. 
In hindsight I think it might have been demons forcing themselves into my life due to the sinful decisions I was making at the time. I mean it could have just been the anxiety but I think those things just go hand in hand. Has anyone els experienced any of these or similar things and come to any conclusions?

Sleepparalysis,"So, I was diagnosed 15 years ago with epilepsy. They couldn’t find a trigger, but whenever I had a seizure it would be grand mal (jerky/shaking) and very rarely petit mal (just vacant). I’ve been on the same medication for 10 years without a seizure.

This week I’ve been very unwell with tonsillitis and fever and now I’m antibiotics. Today was my first day back at work and I found I was very anxious trying to fall asleep last night. My thoughts as I was falling asleep were very odd, as though they weren’t my own, like I was just watching them go.

At 4am I’m just finishing a guided meditation when I feel like I’m buzzing/vibrating and go to yell out but I can’t move. I also thought someone had ran into my room and was sitting on my bed, then ran back out.

Now there’s two sides to the event I’m going to tell you one of which is mine and the other is my partner so here’s mine first.

One night like any normal night I went to bed and fell asleep with my partner and then all of a sudden my eyes were open I couldn’t move and I had a sensation of pins and needles all throughout my body as I looked around my bedroom I noticed 3 odd figures that couldn’t have just been the dark playing tricks on my eyes as I stared at the figures trying to see what they was one of them moved and looked like it was pointing to just above my head then another one moved closer revealing what seemed to be a burnt horrible looking face the third just stood in place quietly. scared I started to try and move or talk but I couldn’t as usual Then all of a sudden the third figure started to make noises like a whispering noise but I couldn’t here what it was saying the sound was strange it felt as though it was burning my ears I screamed my partners name at this point I was shocked I can never usually talk but I managed to scream her name so I repeated it over and over until the figure that was moving was right by my head it leaned over looked into my eyes and then the third figure shouted it’s done and then I could move my partner was crying and wouldn’t open her eyes. 

Now my partners side 

I woke up to jack spelling out my name in a very stern voice it was almost like it wasn’t his voice he was really warm to the touch he then started spelling out help I was scared I didn’t know what to do I sat there trying to wake him up but nothing was working his eyes were open and he was staring towards the foot of the bed just as I raised my head and looked towards the  foot of the bed I heard in a voice that didn’t seem female nor male “It’s Done” I closed my eyes and felt they air go from a warm to a chill.


I’ve had sleep paralysis a lot of times over the past five years but never like this no one else has ever experienced my sleep paralysis and the scariest thing is ever since it happened 3 days ago I’ve had a horrible feeling over me of being scared for my life and just really bad depression where as the day before it happened I was really happy and everything was fine.

Sleepparalysis,"A little bit of context: 
I haven't been sleeping much, or if I have been sleeping, its been for 11+ hours. I am a college student so these very peculiar sleeping patterns are typically the norm. I also have anxiety and some other sleep disturbances like night panic attacks. I don't usually experience sleep paralysis a lot, but I have 3 presentations this week and a lab, so I am extremely stressed out, and only got 5 hours of sleep last night having gone to bed at around 4AM.

This is what happened... It was about 5 in the evening when I decided I needed to take a nap. I was exhausted from only 5 hours of sleep and having to wake up for my first presentation at 9 AM. This being said, I was pretty anxious when I feel asleep and figured I might feel better when I wake up and am a bit more rested. Boy was I wrong. 

I don't really remember falling asleep but - obviously - I did. What I do recall was this overwhelming urge to wake up. I tried to wake up and I just couldn't... I remember thinking ""ah man not this again"" and ""now ill have to wait for an alarm to wake me up or something"". But things got much, much worse. After those couple of seconds, I fell back into a deep sleep where I started lucid dreaming. The thing is: I HATE lucid dreaming. For me, it's not all of that ""oh yeah lets dream about going to a theme park or walking on ceilings!""... no, this lucid dream had me in my room, walking around. Dancing around. Knowing everything was off and weird and my movements felt heavy. I remember flashes of scenes where I would put my head back and my body would get this overwhelming sinking feeling and it would be like I was in a new scene. I was now talking with my roommate and had some disturbing thoughts in the dreams that I ignored. All of a sudden, I became aware and wanted to wake up but I couldn't. I briefly remember trying with all of might to get up from bed and only making it about 1 cm above the bed and my eyes shot open. My hands and arms were numb and tingling and I immediately fell back into my sleep. 

I didn't go back to lucid dreaming. I had this horrific twisting cramp start in my side and I remember thinking ""oh great, my appendix has burst or something and now I can't even wake up to get help""... then all of a sudden the cramp got worse and worse and worse until I remember clenching up my face then BOOM...

I was awake. Sweating, panicked, laying there exhausted. It took everything in me to not immediately fall back asleep again. I immediately called my family and tried to sit up so I wouldn't fall back asleep. I looked at the time and I had only been out for about 30 minutes - when I thought I had been asleep for over 2 hours. Luckily I was able to shake off the experience but good god am I still exhausted and feeling drained. It took a while to stop feeling faint as well (I have vasovagal syncope) which sparked the fear that I would pass out and fall asleep only to experience more sleep paralysis. 

That's my experience this time. Hopefully tonight's actual slumber will be better. Might try to have a sleep over or something just to ease my fears a bit. Thanks for listening, it was a terrifying experience that I cried for about 20 minutes about.
